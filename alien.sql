(23, 'UFO sightings in Canada', 'Below is a partial list of alleged sightings of unidentified flying objects or UFOs in Canada.\n\n\n== 1960, Clan Lake, Northwest Territories ==\nOn June 18, 1960, a prospector told the Yellowknife RCMP detachment that a month earlier, he and his partner saw a UFO at Clan Lake, located 30 miles north of Yellowknife. According to UFOlogist Chris Rutkowski, the men claimed they saw a hovering object 4 to 6 feet wide that hit the surface of the lake. The RCMP investigated, but found nothing.\n\n\n== 1967, Falcon Lake, Manitoba incident ==\nStefan Michalak claimed he was burned by one of two flying saucers with which he reportedly came into contact on May 19, 1967 near Falcon Lake (Manitoba). Ufologists claim that images of Michalak in the hospital show a grid of burn marks on his chest, and a similar grid appears burned into his t-shirt. Ufologists consider it to be one of the most documented UFO stories in Canada.Two books have been written on the alleged Falcon Lake occurrence:\n\n(2017). Stan Michalak, Chris Rutkowski. When They Appeared Falcon Lake 1967: The inside story of a close encounter. ISBN 9781772800951\n(2015). George Dudding. The Falcon Lake UFO Encounter. ISBN 978-1514246825Skeptic Dr. Aaron Sakulich reviewed the report made by Michalak to police shortly after the incident, along with other evidence, and concluded that Michalak was indeed burned but that the burns were in fact likely caused by an accident brought on by alcohol consumption, and that Michalak, who was prospecting for silver ore near the lake at the time, probably made the story up to keep other prospectors out of the area.In April 2018, the Royal Canadian Mint released a $20 silver coin depicting the alleged event as part of its Canada\'s Unexplained Phenomena series, stating \"According to Stefan Michalak’s account, two glowing objects descended from the sky on May 20, 1967, near Falcon Lake, Manitoba, where one landed close enough for him to approach. When the craft suddenly took flight, its emission set Michalak’s clothes ablaze, leaving him with mysterious burns… and an unusual tale to tell.\"\n\n\n== 1967, Shag Harbour, Nova Scotia incident ==\n\nThe incident was the purported crash of an Unidentified Flying Object in Shag Harbour, Nova Scotia in October 1967.\n\n\n== 1969, Prince George, B.C. UFO ==\nIn Prince George, British Columbia, three unrelated witnesses reported a strange, round object in the late afternoon sky on January 1, 1969. The sphere radiated a yellow-orange light and appeared to ascend from 2,000 to 10,000 feet.\n\n\n== 1975-1976, Southern Manitoba ==\nSeveral sightings were reported of a red glowing UFO, sometimes described as \"mischievous\" or \"playful\", sighted in Southern Manitoba in 1975 and 1976.\n\n\n== 1978, Clarenville, Newfoundland and Labrador ==\nIn October 1978, Constable Jim Blackwood of the RCMP witnessed a sighting of a flying saucer hovering over the harbour near the town of Clarenville and Random Island.  This was reported to him by local citizens.  When he arrived at the scene the UFO was still present and quite visible. He had a special high powered viewing scope which happened to be on loan at the time for other surveillance.  The craft stayed in the area for approximately an hour and a half.  When he switched on the roof lights of his police cruiser the craft appeared to mimic the flashing lights.  This made headline news at the time and was broadcast on CBC television and NTV broadcasting in Newfoundland.  The craft took off like a shooting star high in the sky and disappeared. Two years after the incident the BBC did a documentary on UFO sightings and included the Clarenville sighting in their broadcast.  In later years Cst Blackwood retired to his native home in Stellarton, Nova Scotia.\n\n\n== 1986, Munros Point, Nova Scotia Sighting ==\nIn the early evening of January 20, 1986 a couple travelling by car on a rural road in Cape Breton, NS witnessed a bright light appear and hover directly over their car. Almost immediately their vehicle lost power. After watching the blinding light for less than a minute, they watched it quickly accelerate away from them, lighting up the ground below the object as it departed.\n\n\n== 1989, Marieville, Quebec ==\nOn November 20 at 5.30 p.m., in Sainte-Marie-de-Monnoir (a rural neighbourhood of Marieville) several people heard a noise similar to an electric generator and saw some strange lights in the sky.

Eyewitnesses saw 8 to 10 lights forming into a circle above them, emitting bright white rays. The phenomenon lasted three hours, from 7 to 10 p.m., and moved slowly northwards. While none could identify the lights, a few witnesses, according to the next day’s report in La Presse, were ready to express their belief that they were visited by aliens.A few witnesses say what they saw in a televised interview on CBC.\n\n\n== 2006, Ajax, Ontario ==\nA UFO was photographed in Ajax, Ontario.\n\n\n== 2010, Harbour Mille incident ==\nDuring the night of January 25, 2010 there were multiple UFO sighting reports in Harbour Mille, Newfoundland and Labrador. Royal Canadian Mounted Police initially stated the reports were due to a missile launch, but later retracted the statement, and the Office of the Prime Minister stated that the UFOS were not missiles. Another minor report of this incident came from Calgary where boys playing hockey reported seeing similar objects, about which they stated \"We thought they were Transformers\"\n\n\n== 2014, Kensington, PEI Sighting ==\nWhile putting out a bonfire late in the evening of June 4, 2014, John Sheppard witnessed unusual lights in the sky over the Gulf of St. Lawrence and captured 22 minutes of it on his cellphone.

(24, 'Reported UFO sightings in the United Kingdom', 'This is a list of notable alleged sightings of unidentified flying objects or UFOs in the UK. Many more sightings have become known since the gradual release of the MoD UFO sighting reports by the National Archives in 2008. In recent years there have been many sightings of groups of slowly moving lights in the night sky, which can be easily explained as Chinese lanterns. Project Condign, undertaken from 1997 to 2000, concluded that all the investigated sightings of unidentified aerial phenomena in the U.K. could be assigned to misidentified but explicable objects, or poorly understood natural phenomena.\n\n\n== 12th century ==\n1113: Religious pilgrims in southwest England reported seeing a glowing fire-belching \"dragon\" emerge from the sea, flying into the air, and disappearing into the sky.\n\n\n== 13th century ==\nJanuary 1254: In St. Albans, England, a scribe wrote of a glowing floating light, thus recorded it, \"...in serene sky and clear air, with stars shining and the Moon eight days old, there suddenly appeared in the sky a kind of large ship elegantly shaped, well equipped and of marvelous color.\"\n1290: Friars of Byland Abbey, described of \"a flat, round shining silvery object\" flying overhead of them.\n\n\n== 20th century ==\nFebruary 1942: A woman named Eileen Arnold was walking down Cheltenham high street when she suddenly experienced an altered state of consciousness as she became \"tuned into another reality\". She became aware of a large oval shape moving slowly above the rooftops.  She stated that it radiated light from holes in its side and had quills which detached one by one, also emitting light.  Following this, Eileen believed she had numerous psychic experiences.\nSeptember 1942: Albert Lancaster believes he was abducted by aliens while working as a guard at a radar site near Newbiggin-on-Sea, Northumbria. He claimed to have a sudden urge to go outside followed by a \"strange impulse to look at the sky.\" He claims he saw a glowing light surrounded by dark mist and, assuming it was a German weapon, went to raise the alarm before being struck by a beam of light from the cloud followed by a floating sensation then becoming aware he was back at his post.  Following this experience he believed he had psychic powers for a period of time.\n5 August 1944: According to records released on 5 August 2010, British wartime prime minister Winston Churchill banned the reporting for 50 years of an alleged UFO incident because of fears it could create mass panic.  Reports given to Churchill claimed the incident allegedly involved a Royal Air Force (RAF) reconnaissance plane returning from a mission in France or Germany toward the end of the Second World War. It was over or near the English coastline when it was allegedly suddenly intercepted by a strange metallic object that matched the aircraft\'s course and speed for a time before accelerating away and disappearing.  The plane\'s crew were reported to have photographed the object, which they said had \"hovered noiselessly\" near the aircraft, before moving off.  According to the documents, details of the cover-up emerged when the man wrote to the government in 1999 seeking to find out more about the incident. He described how his grandfather, who served with the RAF in the Second World War, was present when Churchill and U.S. General Dwight Eisenhower discussed how to deal with the UFO encounter.  The files come from more than 5,000 pages of UFO reports and letters and drawings from members of the public, as well as questions raised by Members of Parliament in the Parliament of the United Kingdom.  They are available to download for free for a month from The National Archives website.\n1 June 1950: A Gloster Meteor at RAF Tangmere passes a flying saucer lit up with lights; this was described as \'Britain\'s first flying saucer\'. The object was reported to be shining, revolving, and disc-like at 20,000 ft at 14.30, flying eastwards over the Portsmouth area. RAF Tangmere asked the radar station at RAF Wartling in Sussex if it had seen the object, and it had on its PPI screen. It led to the setting up of the Flying Saucer Working Party.\n14 August 1950: A 50 ft-diameter disc UFO is seen over the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE) at 11.27 by an experienced pilot F/Lt. Hubbard. He claimed to see another similar object on 5 September 1950 at 16.09.\n14–25 September 1952: Operation Mainbrace - many UFOs were observed.

Car engines nearby to the object stalled. It was seen by around thirty people and made a humming noise and landed at the junction of Ashbourne Road and Whitfield Road. It hovered over Bedonwell Primary School (now Bedonwell Junior School) for around one minute. It finally shot off into the sky. Another UFO had landed a few streets away at the same time. A similar object had been seen in Bexleyheath in 1952.\n13 August 1956: Lakenheath-Bentwaters incident - 12 to 15 objects were picked up by USAF radar over East Anglia.

They saw a bright object in the shape of a cross at tree-top height at a distance of about 40 metres. They followed the \'pulsating\' object for about fifteen minutes along the road at speeds up to 80 mph. The object was described as being star-spangled like \'looking through wet glass\'. At 4:23 am it was joined by a second object. A motorist, Mr Christopher Garner of Hatherleigh, had also seen it and thought he was having a nightmare.

(26, 'Project Blue Book', 'Project Blue Book was one of a series of systematic studies of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) conducted by the United States Air Force. It started in 1952, the third study of its kind (the first two were projects Sign (1947) and Grudge (1949)). A termination order was given for the study in December 1969, and all activity under its auspices ceased in January 1970.\nProject Blue Book had two goals:\n\nTo determine if UFOs were a threat to national security, and\nTo scientifically analyze UFO-related data.Thousands of UFO reports were collected, analyzed, and filed. As a result of the Condon Report (1968), which concluded there was nothing anomalous about UFOs, and a review of the report by the National Academy of Sciences, Project Blue Book was terminated in December 1969.  The Air Force provides the following summary of its investigations:\n\nNo UFO reported, investigated and evaluated by the  Air Force was ever an indication of threat to our national security;\nThere  was no evidence submitted to or discovered by the Air Force that  sightings categorized as \"unidentified\" represented technological  developments or principles beyond the range of modern scientific  knowledge; and\nThere was no evidence indicating that sightings  categorized as \"unidentified\" were extraterrestrial vehicles.\nBy the time Project Blue Book ended, it had collected 12,618 UFO reports, and concluded that most of them were misidentifications of natural phenomena (clouds, stars, etc.) or conventional aircraft. According to the National Reconnaissance Office a number of the reports could be explained by flights of the formerly secret reconnaissance planes U-2 and A-12. A small percentage of UFO reports were classified as unexplained, even after stringent analysis. The UFO reports were archived and are available under the Freedom of Information Act, but names and other personal information of all witnesses have been redacted.\n\n\n== Previous projects ==\nPublic USAF UFO studies were first initiated under Project Sign at the end of 1947, following many widely publicized UFO reports (see Kenneth Arnold). Project Sign was initiated specifically at the request of General Nathan Twining, chief of the Air Force Materiel Command at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. Wright-Patterson was also to be the home of Project Sign and all subsequent official USAF public investigations.\nSign was officially inconclusive regarding the cause of the sightings. However, according to US Air Force Captain Edward J. Ruppelt (the first director of Project Blue Book), Sign\'s initial intelligence estimate (the so-called Estimate of the Situation) written in the late summer of 1948, concluded that the flying saucers were real craft, were not made by either the Soviet Union or United States, and were likely extraterrestrial in origin. (See also extraterrestrial hypothesis.) This estimate was forwarded to the Pentagon, but subsequently ordered destroyed by Gen. Hoyt Vandenberg, USAF Chief of Staff, citing a lack of physical proof. Vandenberg subsequently dismantled Project Sign.\nProject Sign was succeeded at the end of 1948 by Project Grudge, which was criticized as having a debunking mandate. Ruppelt referred to the era of Project Grudge as the \"dark ages\" of early USAF UFO investigation. Grudge concluded that all UFOs were natural phenomena or other misinterpretations, although it also stated that 23 percent of the reports could not be explained.\n\n\n=== Captain Ruppelt era ===\nAccording to Captain Edward J. Ruppelt, by the end of 1951, several high-ranking, very influential USAF generals were so dissatisfied with the state of Air Force UFO investigations that they dismantled Project Grudge and replaced it with Project Blue Book in March 1952. One of these men was Gen. Charles P. Cabell. Another important change came when General William Garland joined Cabell\'s staff; Garland thought the UFO question deserved serious scrutiny because he had witnessed a UFO.The new name, Project Blue Book, was selected to refer to the blue booklets used for testing at some colleges and universities. The name was inspired, said Ruppelt, by the close attention that high-ranking officers were giving the new project; it felt as if the study of UFOs was as important as a college final exam. Blue Book was also upgraded in status from Project Grudge, with the creation of the Aerial Phenomenon Branch.Ruppelt was the first head of the project. He was an experienced airman, having been decorated for his efforts with the Army Air Corps during World War II, and having afterward earned an aeronautics degree. He officially coined the term \"Unidentified Flying Object\", to replace the many terms (\"flying saucer\" \"flying disk\" and so on) the military had previously used; Ruppelt thought that \"unidentified flying object\" was a more neutral and accurate term. Ruppelt resigned from the Air Force some years later, and wrote the book The Report on Unidentified Flying Objects, which described the study of UFOs by United States Air Force from 1947 to 1955.  American scientist Michael D. Swords wrote that \"Ruppelt would lead the last genuine effort to analyze UFOs\".Ruppelt implemented a number of changes: He streamlined the manner in which UFOs were reported to (and by) military officials, partly in hopes of alleviating the stigma and ridicule associated with UFO witnesses. Ruppelt also ordered the development of a standard questionnaire for UFO witnesses, hoping to uncover data which could be subject to statistical analysis. He commissioned the Battelle Memorial Institute to create the questionnaire and computerize the data. Using case reports and the computerized data, Battelle then conducted a massive scientific and statistical study of all Air Force UFO cases, completed in 1954 and known as \"Project Blue Book Special Report No. 14\" (see summary below).\nKnowing that factionalism had harmed the progress of Project Sign, Ruppelt did his best to avoid the kinds of open-ended speculation that had led to Sign\'s personnel being split among advocates and critics of the extraterrestrial hypothesis. As Michael Hall writes, \"Ruppelt not only took the job seriously but expected his staff to do so as well. If anyone under him either became too skeptical or too convinced of one particular theory, they soon found themselves off the project.\" In his book, Ruppelt reported that he fired three personnel very early in the project because they were either \"too pro\" or \"too con\" one hypothesis or another. Ruppelt sought the advice of many scientists and experts, and issued regular press releases (along with classified monthly reports for military intelligence).\nEach U.S. Air Force Base had a Blue Book officer to collect UFO reports and forward them to Ruppelt. During most of Ruppelt\'s tenure, he and his team were authorized to interview any and all military personnel who witnessed UFOs, and were not required to follow the chain of command. This unprecedented authority underlined the seriousness of Blue Book\'s investigation.\nUnder Ruppelt\'s direction, Blue Book investigated a number of well-known UFO cases, including the so-called Lubbock Lights, and a widely publicized 1952 radar/visual case over Washington D.C.. According to Jacques Vallee, Ruppelt started the trend, largely followed by later Blue Book investigations, of not giving serious consideration to numerous reports of UFO landings and/or interaction with purported UFO occupants.\nAstronomer Dr. J. Allen Hynek was the scientific consultant of the project, as he had been with Projects Sign and Grudge. He worked for the project up to its termination and initially created the categorization which has been extended and is known today as Close encounters. He was a pronounced skeptic when he started, but said that his feelings changed to a more wavering skepticism during the research, after encountering a minority of UFO reports he thought were unexplainable. \nRuppelt left Blue Book in February 1953 for a temporary reassignment. He returned a few months later to find his staff reduced from more than ten, to two subordinates. Frustrated, Ruppelt suggested that an Air Defense Command unit (the 4602nd Air Intelligence Service Squadron) be charged with UFO investigations.\n\n\n==== Robertson Panel ====\n\nIn July 1952, after a build-up of hundreds of sightings over the previous few months, a series of radar detections coincident with visual sightings were observed near the National Airport in Washington, D.C. (see 1952 Washington D.C. UFO incident). Future Arizona Senator and 2008 presidential nominee, the late, John McCain is alleged to be one of these witnesses.\nAfter much publicity, these sightings led the Central Intelligence Agency to establish a panel of scientists headed by Dr. H. P. Robertson, a physicist of the California Institute of Technology, which included various physicists, meteorologists, and engineers, and one astronomer (Hynek). The Robertson Panel first met on January 14, 1953 in order to formulate a response to the overwhelming public interest in UFOs.\nRuppelt, Hynek, and others presented the best evidence, including movie footage, that had been collected by Blue Book. After spending 12 hours reviewing 6 years of data, the Robertson Panel concluded that most UFO reports had prosaic explanations, and that all could be explained with further investigation, which they deemed not worth the effort.\nIn their final report, they stressed that low-grade, unverifiable UFO reports were overloading intelligence channels, with the risk of missing a genuine conventional threat to the U.S. Therefore, they recommended the Air Force de-emphasize the subject of UFOs and embark on a debunking campaign to lessen public interest. They suggested debunkery through the mass media, including Walt Disney Productions, and using psychologists, astronomers, and celebrities to ridicule the phenomenon and put forward prosaic explanations. Furthermore, civilian UFO groups \"should be watched because of their potentially great influence on mass thinking ... The apparent irresponsibility and the possible use of such groups for subversive purposes should be kept in mind.\"\nIt is the conclusion of many researchers that the Robertson Panel was recommending controlling public opinion through a program of official propaganda and spying. They also believe these recommendations helped shape Air Force policy regarding UFO study not only immediately afterward, but also into the present day. There is evidence that the Panel\'s recommendations were being carried out at least two decades after its conclusions were issued (see the main article for details and citations).\nIn December 1953, Joint Army-Navy-Air Force Regulation number 146 made it a crime for military personnel to discuss classified UFO reports with unauthorized persons. Violators faced up to two years in prison and/or fines of up to $10,000.\n\n\n==== Aftermath of Robertson Panel ====\nIn his book (see external links) Ruppelt described the demoralization of the Blue Book staff and the stripping of their investigative duties following the Robertson Panel jurisdiction.\nAs an immediate consequence of the Robertson Panel recommendations, in February 1953, the Air Force issued Regulation 200-2, ordering air base officers to publicly discuss UFO incidents only if they were judged to have been solved, and to classify all the unsolved cases to keep them out of the public eye.\nThe same month, investigative duties started to be taken on by the newly formed 4602nd Air Intelligence Squadron (AISS) of the Air Defense Command. The 4602nd AISS was assigned the task of investigating only the most important UFO cases with intelligence or national security implications. These cases were deliberately siphoned away from Blue Book, leaving Blue Book to deal with the more trivial reports.\nGeneral Nathan Twining, who started Project Sign in 1947, was now Air Force Chief of Staff. In August 1954, he was to further codify the responsibilities of the 4602nd AISS by issuing an updated Air Force Regulation 200-2. In addition, UFOs (called \"UFOBs\") were defined as \"any airborne object which by performance, aerodynamic characteristics, or unusual features, does not conform to any presently known aircraft or missile type, or which cannot be positively identified as a familiar object.\"  Investigation of UFOs was stated to be for the purposes of national security and to ascertain \"technical aspects.\" AFR 200-2 again stated that Blue Book could discuss UFO cases with the media only if they were regarded as having a conventional explanation. If they were unidentified, the media was to be told only that the situation was being analyzed. Blue Book was also ordered to reduce the number of unidentified to a minimum.\nAll this work was done secretly. The public face of Blue Book continued to be the official Air Force investigation of UFOs, but the reality was it had essentially been reduced to doing very little serious investigation, and had become almost solely a public relations outfit with a debunking mandate. To cite one example, by the end of 1956, the number of cases listed as unsolved had dipped to barely 0.4 percent, from the 20 to 30% only a few years earlier.\nEventually, Ruppelt requested reassignment; at his departure in August 1953, his staff had been reduced from more than ten (precise numbers of personnel varied) to just two subordinates and himself. His temporary replacement was a noncommissioned officer. Most who succeeded him as Blue Book director exhibited either apathy or outright hostility to the subject of UFOs, or were hampered by a lack of funding and official support.\nUFO investigators often regard Ruppelt\'s brief tenure at Blue Book as the high-water mark of public Air Force investigations of UFOs, when UFO investigations were treated seriously and had support at high levels. Thereafter, Project Blue Book descended into a new \"Dark Ages\" from which many UFO investigators argue it never emerged. However, Ruppelt later came to embrace the Blue Book perspective that there was nothing extraordinary about UFOs; he even labeled the subject a \"Space Age Myth.\"\n\n\n=== Captain Hardin era ===\nIn March 1954, Captain Charles Hardin was appointed the head of Blue Book; however, the 4602nd conducted most UFO investigations, and Hardin did not object. Ruppelt wrote that Hardin \"thinks that anyone who is even interested [in UFOs] is crazy. They bore him.\"In 1955, the Air Force decided that the goal of Blue Book should not be to investigate UFO reports, but to minimize the number of unidentified UFO reports. By late 1956, the number of unidentified sightings had dropped from the 20-25% of the Ruppelt era, to less than 1%.\n\n\n=== Captain Gregory era ===\nCaptain George T. Gregory took over as Blue Book\'s director in 1956. Clark writes that Gregory led Blue Book \"in an even firmer anti-UFO direction than the apathetic Hardin.\" The 4602nd was dissolved, and the 1066th Air Intelligence Service Squadron was charged with UFO investigations.\nIn fact, there was actually little or no investigation of UFO reports; a revised AFR 200-2 issued during Gregory\'s tenure emphasized that unexplained UFO reports must be reduced to a minimum.\nOne way that Gregory reduced the number of unexplained UFOs was by simple reclassification. \"Possible cases\" became \"probable\", and \"probable\" cases were upgraded to certainties. By this logic, a possible comet became a probable comet, while a probable comet was flatly declared to have been a misidentified comet. Similarly, if a witness reported an observation of an unusual balloon-like object, Blue Book usually classified it as a balloon, with no research and qualification. These procedures became standard for most of Blue Book\'s later investigations; see Hynek\'s comments below.\n\n\n=== Major Friend era ===\nMajor Robert J. Friend was appointed the head of Blue Book in 1958. Friend made some attempts to reverse the direction Blue Book had taken since 1954. Clark writes that \"Friend\'s efforts to upgrade the files and catalog sightings according to various observed statistics were frustrated by a lack of funding and assistance.\"Heartened by Friend\'s efforts, Hynek organized the first of several meetings between Blue Book staffers and ATIC personnel in 1959. Hynek suggested that some older UFO reports should be reevaluated, with the ostensible aim of moving them from the \"unknown\" to the \"identified\" category. Hynek\'s plans came to naught.\nDuring Friend\'s tenure, ATIC contemplated passing oversight Blue Book to another Air Force agency, but neither the Air Research and Development Center, nor the Office of Information for the Secretary of the Air Force was interested.\nIn 1960, there were U.S. Congressional hearings regarding UFOs. Civilian UFO research group NICAP had publicly charged Blue Book with covering up UFO evidence, and had also acquired a few allies in the U.S. Congress. Blue Book was investigated by the Congress and the CIA, with critics—most notably the civilian UFO group NICAP asserting that Blue Book was lacking as a scientific study. In response, ATIC added personnel (increasing the total personnel to three military personnel, plus civilian secretaries) and increased Blue Book\'s budget. This seemed to mollify some of Blue Book\'s critics, that but it was only temporary. A few years later (see below), the criticism would be even louder.\nBy the time he was transferred from Blue Book in 1963, Friend thought that Blue Book was effectively useless and ought to be dissolved, even if it caused an outcry amongst the public.\n\n\n=== Major Quintanilla era ===\nMajor Hector Quintanilla took over as Blue Book\'s leader in August 1963. He largely continued the debunking efforts, and it was under his direction that Blue Book received some of its sharpest criticism. UFO researcher Jerome Clark goes so far as to write that, by this time, Blue Book had \"lost all credibility.\"Physicist and UFO researcher Dr. James E. McDonald once flatly declared that Quintanilla was \"not competent\" from either a scientific or an investigative perspective, although he also stressed that Quintanilla \"shouldn\'t be held accountable for it,\" as he was chosen for his position by a superior officer, and was following orders in directing Blue Book.Blue Book\'s explanations of UFO reports were not universally accepted, however, and critics — including some scientists — suggested that Project Blue Book performed questionable research or, worse, was perpetrating cover up. This criticism grew especially strong and widespread in the 1960s.\nTake, for example, the many mostly nighttime UFO reports from the midwestern and southeastern United States in the summer of 1965: Witnesses in Texas reported \"multicolored lights\" and large aerial objects shaped like eggs or diamonds. The Oklahoma Highway Patrol reported that Tinker Air Force Base (near Oklahoma City) had tracked up to four UFOs simultaneously, and that several of them had descended very rapidly: from about 22000 feet to about 4000 feet in just a few seconds, an action well beyond the capabilities of conventional aircraft of the era. John Shockley, a meteorologist from Wichita, Kansas, reported that, using the state Weather Bureau radar, he tracked a number of odd aerial objects flying at altitudes between about 6000 and 9000 feet. These and other reports received wide publicity.\nProject Blue Book officially determined the witnesses had mistaken Jupiter or bright stars (such as Rigel or Betelgeuse) for something else.\nBlue Book\'s explanation was widely criticized as inaccurate. Robert Riser, director of the Oklahoma Science and Art Foundation Planetarium offered a strongly worded rebuke of Project Blue Book that was widely circulated: \"That is as far from the truth as you can get. These stars and planets are on the opposite side of the earth from Oklahoma City at this time of year. The Air Force must have had its star finder upside-down during August.\"A newspaper editorial from the Richmond News Leader opined that \"Attempts to dismiss the reported sightings under the rationale as exhibited by Project Bluebook  [sic] won\'t solve the mystery ... and serve only to heighten the suspicion that there\'s something out there that the air force doesn\'t want us to know about\", while a Wichita-based UPI reporter noted  that \"Ordinary radar does not pick up planets and stars.\"Another case that Blue Book\'s critics seized upon was the so-called Portage County UFO Chase, which began at about 5.00am, near Ravenna, Ohio on April 17, 1966. Police officers Dale Spaur and Wilbur Neff spotted what they described as a disc-shaped, silvery object with a bright light emanating from its underside, at about 1000 feet in altitude. They began following the object (which they reported sometimes descended as low as 50 feet), and police from several other jurisdictions were involved in the pursuit. The chase ended about 30 minutes later near Freedom, Pennsylvania, some 85 miles away.\nThe UFO chase made national news, and the police submitted detailed reports to Blue Book. Five days later, following brief interviews with only one of the police officers (but none of the other ground witnesses), Blue Book\'s director, Major Hector Quintanilla, announced their conclusions: The police (one of them an Air Force gunner during the Korean War) had first chased a communications satellite, then the planet Venus.\nThis conclusion was widely derided, and police officers strenuously rejected it. In his dissenting conclusion, Hynek described Blue Book\'s conclusions as absurd: in their reports, several of the police had unknowingly described the moon, Venus and the UFO, though they unknowingly described Venus as a bright \"star\" very near the moon. Ohio Congressman William Stanton said that \"The Air Force has suffered a great loss of prestige in this community ... Once people entrusted with the public welfare no longer think the people can handle the truth, then the people, in return, will no longer trust the government.\"\nIn September 1968, Hynek received a letter from Colonel Raymond Sleeper of the Foreign Technology Division. Sleeper noted that Hynek had publicly accused Blue Book of shoddy science, and further asked Hynek to offer advice on how Blue Book could improve its scientific methods. Hynek was to later declare that Sleeper\'s letter was \"the first time in my 20 year association with the air force as scientific consultant that I had been officially asked for criticism and advice [regarding] ... the UFO problem.\"Hynek wrote a detailed response, dated October 7, 1968, suggesting several areas where Blue Book could improve. In part, he wrote:\n\nDespite Sleeper\'s request for criticism, none of Hynek\'s commentary resulted in any substantial changes in Blue Book.\nQuintanilla\'s own perspective on the project is documented in his manuscript, \"UFOs, An Air Force Dilemma.\" Lt. Col Quintanilla wrote the manuscript in 1975, but it was not published until after his death. Quintanilla states in the text that he personally believed it arrogant to think human beings were the only intelligent life in the universe. Yet, while he found it highly likely that intelligent life existed beyond earth, he had no hard evidence of any extra terrestrial visitation.\n\n\n=== Congressional hearing ===\nIn 1966, a string of UFO sightings in Massachusetts and New Hampshire provoked a Congressional Hearing by the House Committee on Armed Services. According to attachments to the hearing, the Air Force had at first stated that the sightings were the result of a training exercise happening in the area. But NICAP, the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena, reported that there was no record of a plane flying at the time the sightings occurred.  Another report alleged that the UFO was actually a flying billboard advertising gasoline. Raymond Fowler (of NICAP) added his own interviews with the locals, who saw Air Force officers confiscating newspapers with the story of UFOs and telling them not to report what they had seen. Two police officers who had witnessed the UFOs, Eugene Bertrand and David Hunt, wrote a letter to Major Quintanilla stating that they felt their reputations were destroyed by the Air Force. \"It was impossible to mistake what we saw for any kind of military operation, regardless of altitude,\" the irritated officers wrote, adding that there was no way it could have been a balloon or helicopter.\nAccording to Secretary Harold Brown of the Air Force, Blue Book consisted of three steps: investigation, analysis, and the distribution of information gathered to interested parties. After Brown gave permission, the press were invited into the hearing. \nBy the time of the hearing, Blue Book had identified and explained 95% of the reported UFO sightings. None of these were extraterrestrial or a threat to national security. Brown himself proclaimed, \"I know of no one of scientific standing or executive standing with a detailed knowledge of this, in our organization who believes that they came from extraterrestrial sources.\"  Dr. J. Allen Hynek, a science consultant to Blue Book, suggested in an unedited statement that a \"civilian panel of physical and social scientists\" be formed \"for the express purpose of determining whether a major problem really exist\" in regards to UFOs. Hynek remarked that  he has \"not seen any evidence to confirm\" extraterrestrials, \"nor do I know any competent scientist who has, or who believes that any kind of extraterrestrial intelligence is involved.\" \n\n\n=== Condon Committee ===\n\nCriticism of Blue Book continued to grow through the mid-1960s. NICAP\'s membership ballooned to about 15,000, and the group charged the U.S. Government with a cover-up of UFO evidence.\nFollowing U.S. Congressional hearings, the Condon Committee was established in 1966, ostensibly as a neutral scientific research body. However, the Committee became mired in controversy, with some members charging director Edward U. Condon with bias, and critics would question the validity and the scientific rigor of the Condon Report.\nIn the end, the Condon Committee suggested that there was nothing extraordinary about UFOs, and while it left a minority of cases unexplained, the report also argued that further research would not be likely to yield significant results.\n\n\n=== End ===\nIn response to the Condon Committee\'s conclusions, Secretary of the Air Force Robert C. Seamans, Jr. announced that Blue Book would soon be closed, because further funding \"cannot be justified either on the grounds of national security or in the interest of science.\" The last publicly acknowledged day of Blue Book operations was December 17, 1969. However, researcher Brad Sparks, citing research from the May, 1970 issue of NICAP\'s UFO Investigator, reports that the last day of Blue Book activity was actually January 30, 1970. According to Sparks, Air Force officials wanted to keep the Air Force\'s reaction to the UFO problem from overlapping into a fourth decade, and thus altered the date of Blue Book\'s closure in official files.\nBlue Book\'s files were sent to the Air Force Archives at Maxwell Air Force Base in Alabama. Major David Shea was to later claim that Maxwell was chosen because it was \"accessible yet not too inviting.\"Ultimately, Project Blue Book stated that UFOs sightings were generated as a result of:\n\nA mild form of mass hysteria.\nIndividuals who fabricate such reports to perpetrate a hoax or seek publicity.\nPsychopathological persons.\nMisidentification of various conventional objects.In April 2003, the USAF publicly indicated that there were no immediate plans to re-establish any official government UFO study programs. However, in December 2017 it was disclosed that a new secret UFO study titled the Advanced Aviation Threat Identification Program was funded at over 20 million dollars a year from 2007 to 2012.\n\n\n== USAF current official statement on UFOs ==\nBelow is the United States Air Force\'s official statement regarding UFOs, as noted in USAF Fact Sheet 95-03:\nFrom 1947 to 1969, the Air Force investigated Unidentified Flying Objects under Project Blue Book. The project, headquartered at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, was terminated December 17, 1969. Of a total of 12,618 sightings reported to Project Blue Book, 701 remained \"unidentified.\"\nThe decision to discontinue UFO investigations was based on an evaluation of a report prepared by the University of Colorado entitled, \"Scientific Study of Unidentified Flying Objects;\" a review of the University of Colorado\'s report by the National Academy of Sciences; previous UFO studies and Air Force experience investigating UFO reports during 1940 to 1969.\nAs a result of these investigations, studies and experience gained from investigating UFO reports since 1948, the conclusions of Project Blue Book were:\n\nNo UFO reported, investigated, and evaluated by the Air Force has ever given any indication of threat to our national security.\nThere has been no evidence submitted to or discovered by the Air Force that sightings categorized as \"unidentified\" represent technological developments or principles beyond the range of present day scientific knowledge.\nThere has been no evidence indicating the sightings categorized as \"unidentified\" are extraterrestrial vehicles.With the termination of Project Blue Book, the Air Force regulation establishing and controlling the program for investigating and analyzing UFOs was rescinded. Documentation regarding the former Blue Book investigation was permanently transferred to the Modern Military Branch, National Archives and Records Service, and is available for public review and analysis.\nSince the termination of Project Blue Book, nothing has occurred that would support a resumption of UFO investigations by the Air Force.\nThere are a number of universities and professional scientific organizations that have considered UFO phenomena during periodic meetings and seminars. A list of private organizations interested in aerial phenomena may be found in \"Encyclopaedia of Associations\", published by Gale Research. Interest in and timely review of UFO reports by private groups ensures that sound evidence is not overlooked by the scientific community. Persons wishing to report UFO sightings should be advised to contact local law enforcement agencies.\n\n\n=== Post-Blue Book U.S.A.F. UFO activities ===\nAn Air Force memorandum (released via the Freedom of Information Act) dated October 20, 1969 and signed by Brigadier General C.H. Bolander states that even after Blue Book was dissolved, that \"reports of UFOs\" would still \"continue to be handled through the standard Air Force procedure designed for this purpose.\" Furthermore, wrote Bolander, \"Reports of unidentified flying objects which could affect national security ... are not part of the Blue Book system.\" To date, these other investigation channels, agencies or groups are unknown.\nAdditionally, Blum reports that Freedom of Information Act requests show that the U.S. Air Force has continued to catalog and track UFO sightings, particularly a series of dozens of UFO encounters from the late 1960s to the mid-1970s that occurred at U.S. military facilities with nuclear weapons. Blum writes that some of these official documents depart drastically from the normally dry and bureaucratic wording of government paperwork, making obvious the sense of \"terror\" that these UFO incidents inspired in many U.S.A.F. personnel.\n\n\n== Project Blue Book Special Report No. 14 ==\nIn late December 1951, Ruppelt met with members of the Battelle Memorial Institute, a think tank based in Columbus, Ohio. Ruppelt wanted their experts to assist them in making the Air Force UFO study more scientific. It was the Battelle Institute that devised the standardized reporting form. Starting in late March 1952, the Institute started analyzing existing sighting reports and encoding about 30 report characteristics onto IBM punched cards for computer analysis.\nProject Blue Book Special Report No. 14 was their massive statistical analysis of Blue Book cases to date, some 3200 by the time the report was completed in 1954, after Ruppelt had left Blue Book. Even today, it represents the largest such study ever undertaken. Battelle employed four scientific analysts, who sought to divide cases into \"knowns\", \"unknowns\", and a third category of \"insufficient information.\" They also broke down knowns and unknowns into four categories of quality, from excellent to poor. E.g., cases deemed excellent might typically involve experienced witnesses such as airline pilots or trained military personnel, multiple witnesses, corroborating evidence such as radar contact or photographs, etc. In order for a case to be deemed a \"known\", only two analysts had to independently agree on a solution. However, for a case to be called an \"unknown\", all four analysts had to agree. Thus the criterion for an \"unknown\" was quite stringent.\nIn addition, sightings were broken down into six different characteristics — color, number, duration of observation, brightness, shape, and speed — and then these characteristics were compared between knowns and unknowns to see if there was a statistically significant difference.\nThe main results of the statistical analysis were:\n\nAbout 69% of the cases were judged known or identified (38% were considered conclusively identified while 31% were still \"doubtfully\" explained); about 9% fell into insufficient information. About 22% were deemed \"unknown\", down from the earlier 28% value of the Air Force studies.\nIn the known category, 86% of the knowns were aircraft, balloons, or had astronomical explanations. Only 1.5% of all cases were judged to be psychological or \"crackpot\" cases. A \"miscellaneous\" category comprised 8% of all cases and included possible hoaxes.\nThe higher the quality of the case, the more likely it was to be classified unknown. 35% of the excellent cases were deemed unknowns, as opposed to only 18% of the poorest cases.(More detailed statistics can be found at Identified flying objects.)\nDespite this, the summary section of the Battelle Institute\'s final report declared it was \"highly improbable that any of the reports of unidentified aerial objects ... represent observations of technological developments outside the range of present-day knowledge.\"  A number of researchers, including Dr. Bruce Maccabee, who extensively reviewed the data, have noted that the conclusions of the analysts were usually at odds with their own statistical results, displayed in 240 charts, tables, graphs and maps. Some conjecture that the analysts may simply have had trouble accepting their own results or may have written the conclusions to satisfy the new political climate within Blue Book following the Robertson Panel.\nWhen the Air Force finally made Special Report #14 public in October 1955, it was claimed that the report scientifically proved that UFOs did not exist. Critics of this claim note that the report actually proved that the \"unknowns\" were distinctly different from the \"knowns\" at a very high statistical significance level. The Air Force also incorrectly claimed that only 3% of the cases studied were unknowns, instead of the actual 22%. They further claimed that the residual 3% would probably disappear if more complete data were available. Critics counter that this ignored the fact that the analysts had already thrown such cases into the category of \"insufficient information\", whereas both \"knowns\" and \"unknowns\" were deemed to have sufficient information to make a determination. Also the \"unknowns\" tended to represent the higher quality cases, q.e. reports that already had better information and witnesses.\nThe result of the monumental BMI study were echoed by a 1979 French GEPAN report which stated that about a quarter of over 1,600 closely studied UFO cases defied explanation, stating, in part, \"These cases ... pose a real question.\" When GEPAN\'s successor SEPRA closed in 2004, 5800 cases had been analyzed, and the percentage of inexplicable unknowns had dropped to about 14%. The head of SEPRA, Dr. Jean-Jacques Velasco, found the evidence of extraterrestrial origins so convincing in these remaining unknowns, that he wrote a book about it in 2005.\n\n\n== Hynek\'s criticism ==\nHynek was an associate member of the Robertson Panel, which recommended that UFOs needed debunking. A few years later, however, Hynek\'s opinions about UFOs changed, and he thought they represented an unsolved mystery deserving scientific scrutiny. As the only scientist involved with US Government UFO studies from the beginning to the end, he could offer a unique perspective on Projects Sign, Grudge, and Blue Book.\nAfter what he described as a promising beginning with a potential for scientific research, Hynek grew increasingly disenchanted with Blue Book during his tenure with the project, leveling accusations of indifference, incompetence, and of shoddy research on the part of Air Force personnel. Hynek notes that during its existence, critics dubbed Blue Book \"The Society for the Explanation of the Uninvestigated.\"Blue Book was headed by Ruppelt, then Captain Hardin, Captain Gregory, Major Friend, and finally Major Hector Quintanilla. Hynek had kind words only for Ruppelt and Friend. Of Ruppelt, he wrote \"In my contacts with him I found him to be honest and seriously puzzled about the whole phenomenon.\" Of Friend, he wrote \"Of all the officers I worked with in Blue Book, Colonel Friend earned my respect. Whatever private views he may have held, he was a total and practical realist, and sitting where he could see the scoreboard, he recognized the limitations of his office but conducted himself with dignity and a total lack of the bombast that characterized several of the other Blue Book heads.\"He held Quintanilla in especially low regard: \"Quintanilla\'s method was simple: disregard any evidence that was counter to his hypothesis.\" Hynek wrote that during Air Force Major Hector Quintanilla\'s tenure as Blue Book\'s director, \"the flag of the utter nonsense school was flying at its highest on the mast.\" Hynek reported that Sergeant David Moody, one of Quintanilla\'s subordinates, \"epitomized the conviction-before-trial method. Anything that he didn\'t understand or didn\'t like was immediately put into the psychological category, which meant \'crackpot\'.\"\nHynek reported bitter exchanges with Moody when the latter refused to research UFO sightings thoroughly, describing Moody as \"the master of the possible: possible balloon, possible aircraft, possible birds, which then became, by his own hand (and I argued with him violently at times) the probable.\"\n\n\n== Project Blue Book in fiction ==\n\n\n=== Project U.F.O. ===\nProject Blue Book was the inspiration for the 1978–1979 TV show Project U.F.O. (which was known as Project Blue Book in some countries), which was supposedly based on Project Blue Book cases. However, the show frequently went against the actual project conclusions, suggesting on many occasions that some sightings were real extraterrestrials.\n\n\n=== Twin Peaks ===\nProject Blue Book played a major role in the second season of the 1990–1991 TV series Twin Peaks. Major Garland Briggs, an Air Force officer who worked on the program, approaches protagonist Dale Cooper and reveals that Cooper\'s name turned up in an otherwise nonsensical radio transmission intercepted by the Air Force, which inexplicably originated from the woods surrounding the town of Twin Peaks. As the season progresses, it is revealed that the source of the transmission is the transdimensional realm of the Black Lodge, inhabited by beings which feed on the human emotions of pain and suffering; it eventually comes out that Briggs worked with Cooper\'s rival, corrupt FBI agent Windom Earle, on Project Blue Book, and that the two men apparently uncovered evidence of the Lodge during the course of their work.\n\n\n=== Galactica 1980 ===\nEvery episode of the original Battlestar Galactica spin-off series Galactica 1980 ended with a short statement about the U.S. Air Force\'s 1969 Project Blue Book findings that UFOs are not proven to exist and \"are not a threat to national security\".\n\n\n=== Project Blue Book (2019) ===\nProject Blue Book is the inspiration for the drama series Project Blue Book, which began airing on the History Channel in January 2019.\n\n\n== See also ==\nRobertson Panel\nAdvanced Aviation Threat Identification Program\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nGen.

(27, 'UFO sightings in outer space', 'UFO sightings in outer space are sightings of unidentified flying objects reported by astronauts while in space that they could not explain at the time. These sightings have been claimed as evidence for alien visits by ufologists. Some of the alleged sightings never occurred: science fiction writer Otto Binder perpetuated a hoax claiming Apollo 11 Commander Neil Armstrong had encountered UFOs during the Apollo mission. UFO proponents see comments by astronauts or photos processed by NASA as one of the \"strongest bodies of evidence\" because they are considered to be of high trustworthiness; however, NASA Assistant Administrator for Legislative Affairs, Robert F. Allnut, concluded in a 1970 letter, \"after fifteen years of manned space voyages including space stations and landing on the Moon, spacemen have brought back not a shred of evidence -- verbal, photographic, or otherwise -- for the existence of extraterrestrial spacecraft, or \'UFOs\'.\"In 2009, footage from NASA was posted on YouTube by ufologists which \"renew[ed] UFO conspiracy theories that the government is hiding knowledge about its interactions with intelligent life\" by relying on a \"lack of context\" to promote a \"collection of indistinct imagery and allegations\". A number of the incidents were collected for an episode of the 2014 television series Are We Alone?.\n\n\n== Incidents ==\nSome sightings involving astronauts or NASA include:\nDuring the Gemini 4 mission, pilot Jim McDivitt spotted an object that he described as a \"white cylindrical shape with a white pole sticking out of one corner of it.\" He took two pictures of it. His partner, Ed White, was asleep at the time. McDivitt maintains that it was some unknown but man-made piece of debris, while James Oberg argues that it was most likely the Titan II second stage of the craft.In a transcript of Gemini 7 mission, the astronauts mention a \"bogey\" which ufologists have claimed was a reference to a UFO. Oberg, based on his trajectory analysis of the  mission, describes the astronauts\' comments about a \"bogey\" as referring to booster-associated debris, and not a reference to some sort of UFO. The astronaut who made the comments, Frank Borman, later confirmed that what he saw was not a UFO, and that when he offered to go on the television show Unsolved Mysteries to clarify, the producers told him, \"Well, I\'m not sure we want you on the program.\"Within the UFO community, stories have spread that Neil Armstrong was reported to have witnessed multiple UFOs during Apollo 11. An explanation was that the sightings could have been attributed to jettisoned components. Additional stories were accredited to a hoax spread by science fiction writer Otto Binder. Buzz Aldrin says his words were taken out of context from an interview in 2005 about the incident.During a 2005 spacewalk outside the International Space Station, astronaut Leroy Chiao reported seeing lights  in a formation he described as \"in a line\" and \"almost like an upside-down check mark\". The incident was promoted as a possible UFO sighting in the television series Are We Alone?.   Chiao later identified the lights as being from  fishing boats \"hundreds of miles below\".In August 2013, according to NASA TV, astronaut Christopher Cassidy saw a UFO float past the International Space Station near its Progress 52 cargo ship. It was soon identified by Russian flight controllers as an antenna cover from the Zvezda service module.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of reported UFO sightings\nSTS-48#Ice particles\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMorrison, David (2 October 2006). \"Buzz Aldrin\'s UFO Sighting\".

(28, 'UFO sightings in South Africa', 'This is a list of alleged sightings of unidentified flying objects or UFOs in South Africa.\n\n\n== 1965 report ==\nAccording to NICAP and Flying Saucer Review magazine, after midnight on 16 September, police constables Lockem and de Klerk observed a shiny, copper-coloured craft which had landed astride the white middle line of the Pretoria–Bronkhorstspruit road, at a spot that was deserted 5 minutes earlier. Their patrol vehicle allegedly cut out as they watched the craft rapidly ascending, while emitting a sea of flames through two portals below. The 30 feet (9.1 m) wide disc, shaped like a spinning top, darted silently in a northwesterly direction, leaving the asphalt ablaze for many minutes afterwards. According to NICAP, the incident was confirmed in a press release by Lt colonel J. B. Brits, district commandant of Pretoria North, but scientists from the C.S.I.R. who were asked to investigate the 6 ft wide, buckled and charred imprint, ridiculed the saucer explanation. Constable Lockem, aided by a staff artist of Die Vaderland newspaper, provided a sketch of the craft. Residents of the East Rand reported an \"enormous white light\" and a \"red ball\" in their skies earlier that night.\n\n\n== 1970s sightings ==\nIn 1972, Bennie Smith, the owner of a farm near Fort Beaufort in the eastern Cape region of South Africa, says he fired shots at an unknown object hovering at treetop height after a worker named Boer de Klerk alerted him to it. Smith believed his shots were accurately aimed, but had no effect. Police sergeant Piet Kitching and police station commander Van Rensburg stated they arrived and fired shots at the object, described as metallic and shaped like a 44-gallon drum with three legs that changed colors before it flew away. They said they found imprints and markings on the ground they believed were made by the object. It is claimed that the Grahamstown army regiment investigated the site, but the base has no records of such an event. The incident received coverage by international press, and led to businesses capitalizing on the incident, with a tavern calling itself the \"UFO Bar\" and painting flying saucers on the walls and the local Savoy Hotel keeping clippings of the stories posted on its walls. In a humorous editorial, the New Scientist stated the apartheid South African government was \"very fastidious about the sort of immigrants she welcomes and little green men may very well be on the prohibited list\".\nOn the evening of 12 November 1972 four soldiers at the Rosmead military camp in the eastern Cape, observed a rotating set of red lights near their duty room, but these went out before they could investigate. When headmaster Harold Truter arrived about 10 minutes later at Rosmead Junior School, he observed an unusual light hovering silently over a nearby ridge, which was casting an oblique beam to the ground. A \'flickering glow\' over the school\'s locked tennis court caused him to investigate. Broken and molten asphalt and different sets of symmetrically placed imprints were found, subsequently considered to be a UFO landing site. Additional asphalt fragments were found strewn 183 m away on a nearby ridge, and nearby Eucalypt trees were badly scorched and soon died. Additional UFO sightings were claimed from the vicinity.\nOn 31 July 1975 Danie Van Graan, the owner of a farm near Loxton, at 7.50 saw a oval shaped object with rounded windows on the ground. Inside the object he could see four humanoid beings. As he approached, a beam of light was shone on his face and his nose bled. After some minutes the UFO took off.\nOn 29 September 1978 a resident Indian woman reported a disc-shaped object taking off from the Groendal Nature Reserve near Uitenhage, eastern Cape. Three days later, on 2 October, four school boys from Despatch, aged 12 to 16, observed three silvery-clad men in the reserve while hiking. Two of the men arrived from the direction of a shining object, and joined a third to ascend a steep incline on what seemed to be fins, before all disappeared. A set of 9 regular imprints found a month later, was deemed related to the reflective object.\n\n\n== 1991 to 2000 ==\nOn 7 April 1991, at 23:15 pm a hovering triangular craft with red central light, and white star-like lights on each extremity, was observed by a family at Baviaanspoort, Pretoria. A similar craft was sighted in the nearby Eersterust township on the evenings of 8 and 9 April, either stationary or moving. Around the same time in Belgium, the same or a similar craft was sighted.\nOn 18 November 1993, at 10:15 pm, Messrs du Plessis and Venter, residents of Sasolburg, observed a craft arriving from the direction of Vereeniging. The craft departed in a flash in the direction of Parys, but returned some three minutes later. The craft, similar in appearance to a water droplet, was observed to change colour and shape. With time individual lights were distinguished, and the body was determined to be cigar-shaped. While contained in a yellowish to orange glow, it emitted a downward blue light, before once again departing in a flash, upwards.  A nearby town resident claimed to have found imprints of a small craft\'s landing gear, some two months later.\nIn September and October 1994 a farmer at Warrenton claimed to have made repeated observations of a noisy, nighttime craft travelling at great speeds, besides what he described as a \'mothership\'. The craft\'s noise was compared to the sound of a helicopter or Volkswagen Beetle engine. The farmer\'s general claims were supported by four independent observers.\nA UFO flap swept South Africa from late March to mid April 1995, which was widely reported in the media. A farmer, Jan Pienaar, reported a landed craft south of Coligny.\nAt 4:00 am on 28 August 1996 a glowing disc was sighted by sergeant Becker near the Adriaan Vlok police station, Erasmuskloof, Pretoria. The pulsating light contained a red triangle and emitted bright green tentacles, while a radar operator at Johannesburg International confirmed its presence. A chase ensued involving some 200 policemen and a police helicopter. The helicopter chase was given up at 10,000 ft near Bronkhorstspruit, when the object made a vertical ascent. An object was sighted again during the early hours of 31 August and 1 September. See also: Petrozavodsk phenomenon.\nAround the end of July 1997 a hovering, cylindrical light or shiny cloud, was filmed by Andreas Mathios in the sky above the town of Trichardt, in the current western Mpumalanga province. Besides Mathios, it was independently observed by three other persons around 6:50am. The light suddenly dropped and rose again before disappearing. Sasol 2 and 3 allegedly had a temporary power outage that morning. Andreas Mathios phoned air traffic control to get information of any objects over the airspaceTrichardt was also the scene of a 1985 sighting.\nOn 27 December 1998 the Laubscher family videotaped a group of roundish triangular craft passing over the town of Graaff Reinet, at about 25,000 ft. These were changing colour and sometimes circled one another, before being overtaken by a much larger, shiny, gold-coloured craft. At this point all the objects departed to a cloud bank on the horizon.\nIn September 1997 Frank Valentyn (and apparently other motorists) observed an enormous stationary tower of about a dozen stacked discs from the N1 freeway in Pretoria. He suspected that those below were \"daughter discs\" released by the \"mothership\" above, which he estimated to be 1.7 kilometres (1.1 mi) in diameter. The lowest disc in the stack would detach and depart in a seemingly random direction at regular intervals, and each disc had a set of orange lights around its perimeter. He reported his observation to the Johannesburg Planetarium.\nOn 8 May 2000, at 3:24am, police inspector Kriel claimed to have observed an approaching UFO while travelling on the N3 freeway, 70 km north of Warden in the eastern Free State province. The orange, oval-shaped light was fitted with two cupolas, one above and another below, and was wide enough to cover four lanes of the freeway. After a close approach the craft receded again. A follow up report claimed that the vicinity is known for moving light apparitions.\n\n\n== 21st century ==\nOn 27 June 2004, Roshnie Naidu observed and video-taped a very bright, colourful light that was suspended near her home in Durban for 3 hours. She was able to alert family members and neighbours to its presence, and observed it changing shape from circular to oval.\nIn 2009 two formations of high-flying, orange-red objects, were seen by many witnesses, and video-recorded by some, as they travelled between the towns of Middelburg and Witbank, 25 kilometres (16 mi) apart. The first formation of 7 objects were seen at 21:51 on 27 February, as they flew westwards from Middelburg towards Witbank. Due to their altitude they eventually disappeared behind clouds. At 20:00 on 6 March, they were noted again high in the sky, but this time greater in number, 23, and traveling in the opposite direction.\nOn the evenings of 21 and 22 July 2010, residents of Booysens, Pretoria, observed a triangle of bright lights which hung motionless in the sky for two hours. In each instance the object commenced a slow descent towards the horizon at 20:30. Binocular observation revealed nothing more than a blue and emerald light, with a white light which shone straight downwards.\nOn the evenings of 11, 20 and 21 May 2011, a host of silent, orange lights with consistent luminosity were observed as they travelled faster than a commercial aeroplane over Tierpoort near Pretoria (some 20 objects) and Krugersdorp respectively. On 15 June seven of these objects were observed and some photographed as they crossed the sky in single file over Tierpoort. At 22:00 on 30 October 2011, a Mr van Greuning photographed two of the five silent fireballs which he observed traveling southwards in low cloud near the town of Harrismith.\nA reported UFO was spotted in Cape Town on the evening of 28 November 2015. Social media was abuzz with various reports of what seemed to be a green light over the city.\n\n\n== Abduction scenarios ==\n\n\n=== 1956 contactee ===\n\nA well-known photo series depicting a supposed UFO was taken on 24 July near Rosetta in the Drakensberg region. The photographer, meteorologist Elizabeth Klarer, claimed detailed adventures with an alien race, besides having had an alien lover, Akon, who would have fathered her son Ayling.\n\n\n=== 1974 abduction event ===\nTravellers Peter and Frances MacNorman claimed an abduction event on 31 May, which would have started near Fort Victoria in the current southern Zimbabwe, and which would have continued to the vicinity of Beitbridge on the South African border.\n\n\n=== 1979 Mindalore incident ===\nOn January 3, 1979, a mother and her 12-year-old son of Mindalore, Krugersdorp, both claimed an encounter with a group of human-like entities standing beside a craft. One of them would have encouraged her to depart with them permanently. After she refused, they would have entered the craft which shortly shot upwards and disappeared in 30 seconds.\n\n\n== Crash claims and hoaxes ==\n\n\n=== 1982 Mozambican border crash ===\nA person identifying himself only as an apartheid era brigadier general of the South African Army claimed in a 2004 Coast to Coast AM interview with Art Bell, that he was an eye-witness to a crashed disc in November 1982. From a Pretoria air force base, he would have given the order to a Mirage pilot flying hundreds of miles to the east, to fire on a suspected MiG aircraft, that was deemed a risk to ground troops. It allegedly turned out to be a disc, which was brought down very near the Mozambican border. He and his special operations team would have retrieved the 12 feet (3.7 m) wide craft holding two comatose grey beings, and returned these to Pretoria. The supposed artifacts were briefly held at Ysterplaat, Cape Town, before allegedly flown to Andrews Field near Washington, D.C., where U.S. officials took custody. Similar, but evidently baseless reports, have been tied to earlier and later dates.\n\n\n=== 1989 Kalahari crash ===\nAccording to supposed leaked documents an alien craft was shot down by South African aircraft, some 80 miles (130 kilometres) into Botswana, on 7 May. Two alien beings were claimed to have been captured on site. To date no primary witnesses have been traced, while the supporting documents, some obvious fakes, were all obtained from James van Greunen. Researcher Tony Dodd lent Van Greunen some credibility in Quest magazine, but other researchers were highly skeptical. The claims have nonetheless been widely circulated, either as fact or as a case deserving investigation.\n\n\n=== 1995 Lesotho crash ===\nAccording to supposed leaked documents an alien craft crashed in Lesotho on 15 September. It was claimed that South African forces retrieved the craft and took three alien beings captive. The source of these documents is unknown, but is once again suspected to be James van Greunen. Failing to trace any key individuals or witnesses, researcher Michael Hesemann denounced it as \'a complete hoax\'. Other researchers, though skeptical, held out hope to trace witnesses.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of reported UFO sightings\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nScans of Cynthia Hind\'s UFO Afrinews\nUfoRSA, UFO research of South Africa', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0c/Red_pog.svg'),
(29, 'UFO sightings in Mexico', 'This is a list of alleged sightings of unidentified flying objects or UFOs in Mexico.\n\n\n== 1883 ==\n\nOn August 12, 1883, the astronomer José Bonilla reported that he saw \"more than 300 dark, unidentified objects crossing before the Sun\" while observing sunspot activity at Zacatecas Observatory in Mexico. He took a number of wet plate photographs at 1/100th of a second exposure. Although it was later found that the objects were actually high-flying geese, Bonilla is usually given the distinction of having taken the earliest photo of an \"unidentified flying object\", with some UFOlogical literature interpreting the photographs as either alien spacecraft or an unsolved mystery.\n\n\n== 1974 ==\nAccording to UFOlogists, local residents reported a mid-air collision between a UFO and a small airplane near the town of Coyame on August 25, 1974 followed by a military investigation and cover up. However historians say that such \"UFO reports\" were likely prompted by the 1974 crash and military recovery of a Cessna aircraft involved in drug trafficking.\n\n\n== 2004 ==\nOn Friday, March 5, Mexican Air Force pilots using infrared equipment to search for drug-smuggling aircraft recorded 11 unidentified objects over southern Campeche. Mexico’s Defense Department issued a press release on May 12 accompanied by videotape that showed moving bright lights at 11,500 feet. Mexican UFOlogist Jaime Maussan interpreted the videotape as \"proof of alien visitation\", but science writer and skeptic Michael Shermer was critical of witness accounts that \"varied wildly\", saying, \"it was like a fisherman\'s tale, growing with each retelling\", while other experts suggested the lights were most likely burn-off flares on offshore  oil platforms in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of reported UFO sightings\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMUFON - Last 20 UFO Sightings and Pictures', ''),
(30, 'UFO sightings in China', 'This is a list of alleged sightings of unidentified flying objects or UFOs in China.\n\n\n== 1994 ==\nThe Meng Zhaoguo Incident refers to a supposed close encounter of the third kind, experienced by a man of the same name, which purportedly took place in Red Flag Forest in Heilongjiang.  \nIn 1994, Meng Zhaoguo reported that he and a relative had followed what he thought was a weather balloon after they saw a white, shining object descend into Red Flag Forest.After the initial encounter, Meng claimed to be suffering from ongoing harassment from the entities, and reported being taken to their spacecraft and forced to copulate.  He claimed that on the subsequent 17 July he was abducted from his house and shown Mars, which the entities claimed was their homeworld.His story was examined by the UFO Enthusiasts Club at Wuhan University throughout 1997. They concluded that while the initial contact may have occurred, the subsequent reported events were almost certainly untrue. However, other UFO groups in China concluded that his claims were true.\n\n\n== 2010 ==\nJuly 7: An Unidentified flying object was spotted above Hangzhou Xiaoshan International Airport near Hangzhou, China.

(32, 'No. 604 Squadron RAF', 'No. 604 Squadron RAF was a squadron of the Royal Air Force noted for its pioneering role the development of radar-controlled night-fighter operations. The squadron was established in March 1930 at RAF Hendon as a day-bomber squadron of the Royal Auxiliary Air Force. In July 1934, the squadron transitioned to two-seat fighters. Shortly after the commencement of World War II in 1939, the squadron was reassigned to a night-fighter role.\nNo. 604 Squadron was initially disbanded in April 1945 as part of a reduction of the British Armed Forces near the end of the war. It was reformed as an auxiliary single-seat fighter squadron in May 1946, again at RAF Hendon. Final disbandment occurred in March 1957 with the dissolution of the Auxiliary Air Force.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Formation and early years ===\nNo. 604 Squadron was established on 17 March 1930 at RAF Hendon as a squadron of the Royal Auxiliary Air Force. The squadron was initially assigned to the role of day-bombing and received its first aircraft (Airco DH.9As) in April 1930. The DH.9A was soon replaced by the Westland Wapiti in September 1930. Upon re-designation as a two-seat fighter squadron, No. 604 transitioned to the Hawker Hart on 23 July 1934. Hawker Demons replaced the Harts in June 1935.\n\n\n=== World War II ===\nIn early 1939 the squadron transitioned to the long-range fighter variant of the Bristol Blenheim. No. 604 Squadron was activated on 24 August 1939 to operate long-range fighters from RAF North Weald. The squadron spent the first several months of World War II flying defensive patrols in support of coastal convoys.\nThe squadron was reassigned to a night-fighter role in late 1939 and was relocated to RAF Northolt in January 1940. By May 1940, the squadron had moved to RAF Manston. During the squadron\'s stay at RAF Manston that Flying Officer Alistair Hunter and Sergeant Gordon Thomas shot down a Luftwaffe Heinkel 115 floatplane shortly after midnight on 18 June 1940, during the first major night raid over the United Kingdom.  Following the Dunkirk evacuation, the squadron was based at RAF Middle Wallop at the end of July 1940.\nIn early summer 1940, squadron aircraft were fitted with VHF radiotelephone equipment and Mark III Airborne interception (AI) radar. The former was part of RAF Fighter Command policy, and greatly improved air-to-air and air-to ground communication. The AI equipment was fitted to assist the night fighter crews in locating German bombers at night. A new technological development, AI was not particularly reliable at this stage, and needed a third crew member to operate. The external antennas slowed down aircraft that were already considered of low performance for their role. Most AI operators were inexperienced and were forced to learn on the job, translating the information provided on the AI screens into instructions to enable their pilot to get close enough to visually locate and shoot down an enemy bomber.\nLate in September 1940 the squadron received its first Bristol Beaufighter, equipped with four 20-mm Hispano-Suiza HS.404 cannon under the nose and improved Mark IV AI radio-location equipment. As one of the few squadrons thus equipped, 604 Squadron provided night defence over the UK during the Blitz from late 1940 until mid May 1941, when most Luftwaffe bomber units departed for involvement in the invasion of Russia. By this time 50 air victories had been claimed by the squadron—fourteen by F/L John Cunningham.In early 1943 the squadron began to switch over to night intruder operations. In February 1944, the squadron was allocated to the 2nd Tactical Air Force and began conversion to the de Havilland Mosquito. Operations from Normandy began in August but the following month the unit returned to the UK, returning to the continent once again in January 1945. They remained there until disbanding at B.51 at Vendeville, near Lille, France on 18 April 1945. Some 127 air victories had been claimed by the Squadron during the war, 41 since May 1944. A notable member of the squadron, later awarded a posthumous George Cross, was John Quinton DFC.\n\n\n=== Post-war ===\nWith the reactivation of the Royal Auxiliary Air Force, 604 Squadron was reformed on 10 May 1946 at RAF Hendon as a day fighter squadron.

(33, 'Dyatlov Pass incident', 'The Dyatlov Pass incident (Russian: Ги́бель тургру́ппы Дя́тлова) refers to the unsolved deaths of nine ski hikers in the northern Ural Mountains in the Soviet Union (now Russia) between 1 and 2 February 1959. The experienced trekking group, who were all from the Ural Polytechnical Institute, had established a camp on the slopes of Kholat Syakhl in an area now named in honor of the group\'s leader, Igor Dyatlov. During the night, something caused them to tear their way out of their tents and flee the campsite while inadequately dressed for heavy snowfall and sub-zero temperatures.\nAfter the group\'s bodies were discovered, an investigation by Soviet Union authorities determined that six had died from hypothermia while the other three showed signs of physical trauma. One victim had a fractured skull; two others had major chest fractures. Additionally, the body of another team member was missing its tongue and eyes. The investigation concluded that an \"unknown compelling force\" had caused the deaths. Numerous theories have been put forward to account for the unexplained deaths, including animal attacks, hypothermia, avalanche, infrasound-induced panic, military involvement, or some combination of these.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn 1959, a group was formed for a skiing expedition across the northern Urals in Sverdlovsk Oblast, Soviet Union. Igor Dyatlov, a twenty-three-year-old radio engineering student at the Ural Polytechnical Institute (Уральский политехнический институт, УПИ; now Ural Federal University) was the leader who assembled a group of nine others for the trip, most of whom were fellow students and peers at the university. Each member of the group, which consisted of eight men and two women, were experienced Grade II-hikers with ski tour experience, and would be receiving Grade III certification upon their return. At the time, this was the highest certification available in the Soviet Union, and required candidates to traverse 300 kilometres (190 mi). The goal of the expedition was to reach Otorten (Отортен), a mountain 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) north of the site of the incident. This route, in February, was estimated as Category III, the most difficult.\n\n\n== Expedition ==\n\nThe group arrived by train at Ivdel (Ивдель), a town at the centre of the northern province of Sverdlovsk Oblast in the early morning hours of 25 January 1959. They then took a truck to Vizhai (Вижай) – a lorry village that is the last inhabited settlement to the north. While spending the night in Vizhai, the skiers purchased and ate loaves of bread to keep their energy levels up for the following day\'s hike.On 27 January, they began their trek toward Otorten from Vizhai. On 28 January, one of the members, Yuri Yudin, who suffered from several health ailments (including rheumatism and a congenital heart defect) was forced to turn back due to knee and joint pain that made him unable to continue the hike. The remaining group of nine people continued the trek.\nDiaries and cameras found around their last campsite made it possible to track the group\'s route up to the day preceding the incident. On 31 January, the group arrived at the edge of a highland area and began to prepare for climbing. In a wooded valley they cached surplus food and equipment that would be used for the trip back. The following day (1 February), the hikers started to move through the pass. It seems they planned to get over the pass and make camp for the next night on the opposite side, but because of worsening weather conditions — snowstorms and decreasing visibility — they lost their direction and deviated west, up towards the top of Kholat Syakhl. When they realised their mistake, the group decided to stop and set up camp there on the slope of the mountain, rather than moving 1.5 kilometres (0.93 mi) downhill to a forested area which would have offered some shelter from the elements. Yudin postulated that \"Dyatlov probably did not want to lose the altitude they had gained, or he decided to practice camping on the mountain slope.\"\n\n\n== Search and discovery ==\nBefore leaving, Dyatlov had agreed he would send a telegram to their sports club as soon as the group returned to Vizhai. It was expected that this would happen no later than 12 February, but Dyatlov had told Yudin, before his departure from the group, that he expected to be longer. When the 12th passed and no messages had been received, there was no immediate reaction, as delays of a few days were common with such expeditions. It was not until the relatives of the travellers demanded a rescue operation on 20 February that the head of the institute sent the first rescue groups, consisting of volunteer students and teachers. Later, the army and militsiya forces became involved, with planes and helicopters being ordered to join the rescue operation.\nOn 26 February, the searchers found the group\'s abandoned and badly damaged tent on Kholat Syakhl. The campsite baffled the search party. Mikhail Sharavin, the student who found the tent, said \"the tent was half torn down and covered with snow. It was empty, and all the group\'s belongings and shoes had been left behind.\" Investigators said the tent had been cut open from inside. Eight or nine sets of footprints, left by people who were wearing only socks or a single shoe or were even barefoot, could be followed, leading down towards the edge of a nearby woods, on the opposite side of the pass, 1.5 kilometres (0.93 mi) to the north-east. However, after 500 metres (1,600 ft) these tracks were covered with snow. At the forest\'s edge, under a large siberian pine (in popular parlance it is called \"cedar\"), the searchers found the visible remains of a small fire. There were the first two bodies, those of Krivonischenko and Doroshenko, shoeless and dressed only in their underwear. The branches on the tree were broken up to five metres high, suggesting that one of the skiers had climbed up to look for something, perhaps the camp. Between the pine and the camp the searchers found three more corpses: Dyatlov, Kolmogorova and Slobodin, who seemed to have died in poses suggesting that they were attempting to return to the tent. They were found separately at distances of 300, 480 and 630 metres from the tree.\nSearching for the remaining four travellers took more than two months. They were finally found on 4 May under four metres of snow in a ravine 75 metres further into the woods from the pine tree. These four were better dressed than the others, and there were signs that those who had died first had apparently relinquished their clothes to the others. Zolotaryov was wearing Dubinina\'s faux fur coat and hat, while Dubinina\'s foot was wrapped in a piece of Krivonishenko\'s wool trousers.\n\n\n== Investigation ==\n\nA legal inquest started immediately after the first five bodies were found. A medical examination found no injuries that might have led to their deaths, and it was eventually concluded that they had all died of hypothermia. Slobodin had a small crack in his skull, but it was not thought to be a fatal wound.An examination of the four bodies which were found in May shifted the narrative as to what had occurred during the incident. Three of the ski hikers had fatal injuries: Thibeaux-Brignolles had major skull damage, and both Dubinina and Zolotaryov had major chest fractures. According to Dr Boris Vozrozhdenny, the force required to cause such damage would have been extremely high, comparable to the force of a car crash. Notably, the bodies had no external wounds associated with the bone fractures, as if they had been subjected to a high level of pressure. However, major external injuries were found on Dubinina, who was missing her tongue, eyes, part of the lips, as well as facial tissue and a fragment of skullbone; she also had extensive skin maceration on the hands. It was claimed that Dubinina was found lying face down in a small stream that ran under the snow and that her external injuries were in line with putrefaction in a wet environment, and were unlikely to be associated with her death.\nThere was initial speculation that the indigenous Mansi people had attacked and murdered the group for encroaching upon their lands, but investigation indicated that the nature of their deaths did not support this hypothesis; only the hikers\' footprints were visible, and they showed no sign of hand-to-hand struggle.Although the temperature was very low, around −25 to −30 °C (−13 to −22 °F) with a storm blowing, the dead were only partially dressed. Some of them had only one shoe, while others had no shoes or wore only socks. Some were found wrapped in snips of ripped clothes that seemed to have been cut from those who were already dead.\nJournalists reporting on the available parts of the inquest files claim that it states:\n\nSix of the group members died of hypothermia and three of fatal injuries.\nThere were no indications of other people nearby on Kholat Syakhl apart from the nine travellers.\nThe tent had been ripped open from within.\nThe victims had died 6 to 8 hours after their last meal.\nTraces from the camp showed that all group members left the campsite of their own accord, on foot.\nTo dispel the theory of an attack by the indigenous Mansi people, Dr Vozrozhdenny stated that the fatal injuries of the three bodies could not have been caused by another human being, \"because the force of the blows had been too strong and no soft tissue had been damaged\".\nReleased documents contained no information about the condition of the skiers\' internal organs.\nThere were no survivors of the incident.At the time the verdict was that the group members had all died because of a compelling natural force. The inquest officially ceased in May 1959 as a result of the absence of a guilty party. The files were sent to a secret archive.On 12 April 2018 the remains of Semyon Zolotarev were exhumed upon the initiative of journalists of the Russian tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda. Contradictory results were obtained: one of the experts stated that the character of the injuries resembled a person knocked down by a car, and the DNA analysis did not reveal any similarity to the DNA of living relatives. In addition, it turned out that the name of Semyon Zolotarev is not on the list of buried at the Ivanovskoye cemetery. Nevertheless, the reconstruction of the face from the exhumed skull agrees with the post-war photographs of Semyon, although journalists express suspicions that another person was hiding under the name of Semyon Zolotarev after the war.The region was closed to expeditions and hikers for three years after the incident, but is currently accessible.\n\n\n== Related reports ==\n12-year-old Yury Kuntsevich, who later became the head of the Yekaterinburg-based Dyatlov Foundation (see below), attended five of the hikers\' funerals. He recalled that their skin had a \"deep brown tan\".\nAnother group of hikers (about 50 kilometres (31 mi) south of the incident) reported that they saw strange orange spheres in the sky to the north on the night of the incident. Similar spheres were observed in Ivdel and adjacent areas continually during the period from February to March 1959, by various independent witnesses (including the meteorology service and the military). However, these sightings were not noted in the initial investigation in 1959, and these various independent witnesses only came forward years later.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\n\nIn 1967, Sverdlovsk writer and journalist Yuri Yarovoi (Russian: Юрий Яровой) published the novel Of the Highest Degree of Complexity, inspired by the incident. Yarovoi had been involved in the search for Dyatlov\'s group and at the inquest as an official photographer during both the search and the initial stage of the investigation, and so had insight into the events. The book was written during the Soviet era when details of the accident were kept secret and Yarovoi avoided revealing anything beyond the official position and well-known facts. The book romanticised the accident and had a much more optimistic end than the real events – only the group leader was found deceased. Yarovoi\'s colleagues say that he had alternative versions of the novel, but both were declined because of censorship. Since Yarovoi\'s death in 1980, all his archives, including photos, diaries and manuscripts, have been lost.\nAnatoly Gushchin (Russian: Анатолий Гущин) summarized his research in the book The Price of State Secrets Is Nine Lives (Цена гостайны – девять жизней, Sverdlovsk, 1990) Some researchers criticised the novel due to its concentration on the speculative theory of a Soviet secret weapon experiment, but its publication led to public discussion, stimulated by interest in the paranormal. Indeed, many of those who had remained silent for thirty years reported new facts about the accident. One of them was the former police officer, Lev Ivanov (Лев Иванов), who led the official inquest in 1959. In 1990, he published an article which included his admission that the investigation team had no rational explanation for the accident. He also stated that, after his team reported that they had seen flying spheres, he then received direct orders from high-ranking regional officials to dismiss this claim.In 2000, a regional television company produced the documentary film The Mystery of Dyatlov Pass (Тайна перевала Дятлова). With the help of the film crew, a Yekaterinburg writer, Anna Matveyeva (Russian: Анна Матвеева), published a fiction/documentary novella of the same name. A large part of the book includes broad quotations from the official case, diaries of victims, interviews with searchers and other documentaries collected by the film-makers. The narrative line of the book details the everyday life and thoughts of a modern woman (an alter ego of the author herself) who attempts to resolve the case.\nDespite its fictional narrative, Matveyeva\'s book remains the largest source of documentary materials ever made available to the public regarding the incident. In addition, the pages of the case files and other documentaries (in photocopies and transcripts) are gradually being published on a web forum for enthusiastic researchers.A Dyatlov Foundation was founded in  1999 at Yekaterinburg, with the help of Ural State Technical University, led by Yuri Kuntsevitch (Юрий Кунцевич). The foundation\'s stated aim is to continue investigation of the case and to maintain the Dyatlov Museum to preserve the memory of the dead hikers. On 1 July 2016, a memorial plaque was inaugurated in Solikamsk in Ural\'s Perm Region, dedicated to Yuri Yudin (the sole survivor of the expedition group) who died in 2013.\n\n\n== Theories ==\n\n\n=== Avalanche ===\nThe theory that an avalanche caused the hikers\' deaths, while initially popular, has since been questioned. Reviewing the sensationalist \"Yeti\" hypothesis (see below), American skeptic author Benjamin Radford suggests as more plausible:\n\n\"that the group woke up in a panic (...) and cut their way out the tent either because an avalanche had covered the entrance to their tent or because they were scared that an avalanche was imminent (...) (better to have a potentially repairable slit in a tent than risk being buried alive in it under tons of snow). They were poorly clothed because they had been sleeping, and ran to the safety of the nearby woods where trees would help slow oncoming snow. In the darkness of night they got separated into two or three groups; one group made a fire (hence the burned hands) while the others tried to return to the tent to recover their clothing, since the danger had apparently passed. But it was too cold, and they all froze to death before they could locate their tent in the darkness. At some point some of the clothes may have been recovered or swapped from the dead, but at any rate the group of four whose bodies were most severely damaged were caught in an avalanche and buried under 4 metres (13 ft) of snow (more than enough to account for the \'compelling natural force\' the medical examiner described). Dubinina\'s tongue was likely removed by scavengers and ordinary predation.\"Evidence contradicting the avalanche theory includes:The location of the incident did not have any obvious signs of an avalanche having taken place. An avalanche would have left certain patterns and debris distributed over a wide area. The bodies found within ten days of the event were covered with a very shallow layer of snow and, had there been an avalanche of sufficient strength to sweep away the second party, these bodies would have been swept away as well; this would have caused more serious and different injuries in the process and would have damaged the tree line.\nOver 100 expeditions to the region were held since the incident, and none of them ever reported conditions that might create an avalanche. A study of the area using up-to-date terrain-related physics revealed that the location was entirely unlikely for such an avalanche to have occurred. The \"dangerous conditions\" found in another nearby area (which had significantly steeper slopes and cornices) were observed in April and May when the snowfalls of winter were melting. During February, when the incident occurred, there were no such conditions.\nAn analysis of the terrain, the slope and the incline indicates that even if there could have been a very specific avalanche that circumvents the other criticisms, its trajectory would have bypassed the tent. It had collapsed laterally but not horizontally.\nDyatlov was an experienced skier and the much older Alexander Zolotaryov was studying for his Masters Certificate in ski instruction and mountain hiking. Neither of these two men would have been likely to camp anywhere in the path of a potential avalanche.\n\n\n=== Infrasound ===\nAnother hypothesis popularised by Donnie Eichar\'s 2013 book Dead Mountain is that wind going around Kholatsyakal Mountain created a Kármán vortex street, which can produce infrasound capable of inducing panic attacks in humans.\nAccording to Eichar\'s theory, the infrasound generated by the wind as it passed over the top of the Holatchahl mountain was responsible for causing physical discomfort and mental distress in the hikers. Eichar claims that, because of their panic, the hikers were driven to leave the tent by whatever means necessary, and fled down the slope. By the time they were further down the hill, they would have been out of the infrasound\'s path and would have regained their composure, but in the darkness would be unable to return to their shelter. The traumatic injuries suffered by three of the victims were the result of their stumbling over the ledge of a ravine in the darkness and landing on the rocks at the bottom.\n\n\n=== Military tests ===\nSpeculation exists that the campsite fell within the path of a Soviet parachute mine exercise. This theory alleges that the hikers, woken by loud explosions, fled the tent in a shoeless, shell shocked panic and found themselves unable to return for supply retrieval. After some members froze to death attempting to endure the bombardment, others commandeered their clothing only to be fatally injured by subsequent parachute mine concussions. There are indeed records of parachute mines being tested by the Soviet military in the area around the time the hikers were there. Parachute mines detonate while still in the air rather than upon striking the Earth\'s surface and produce signature injuries similar to those experienced by the hikers: Heavy internal damage with comparably less external trauma. The theory coincides with reported sightings of glowing, orange orbs floating or falling in the sky within the general vicinity of the hikers, potentially military aircraft or descending parachute mines. This theory (among others) uses scavenging animals to explain Dubinina\'s injuries. Some speculate the bodies were unnaturally manipulated due to characteristic livor mortis markings discovered during autopsy, as well as burns to hair and skin. Photographs of the tent allegedly show that it was apparently erected incorrectly, something the experienced hikers were unlikely to have done.A similar theory alleges the testing of radiological weapons, and is partly based on the discovery of radioactivity on some of the clothing as well as the bodies being described by relatives as having orange skin and grey hair. However, radioactive dispersal would have affected all of the hikers and equipment instead of just some of it, and the skin and hair discolouration can be explained by a natural process of mummification after three months of exposure to the cold and winds. Furthermore, the initial suppression of files regarding the group\'s disappearance by Soviet authorities is sometimes mentioned as evidence of a cover-up, but the concealment of information regarding domestic incidents was standard procedure in the USSR and therefore far from peculiar. And by the late 1980s, all Dyatlov files had been released in some manner.\n\n\n=== Paradoxical undressing ===\nInternational Science Times posited that the hikers\' deaths were caused by hypothermia, which can induce a behaviour known as paradoxical undressing in which hypothermic subjects remove their clothes in response to perceived feelings of burning warmth. It is undisputed that six of the nine hikers died of hypothermia. However, others in the group appear to have acquired additional clothing (from those who had already died) which suggests that they were of a sound enough mind to try to add layers.\n\n\n=== Pseudoscientific theories ===\nThe 2014 Discovery Channel special Russian Yeti: The Killer Lives explored the theory that the Dyatlov group was killed by a menk or Russian Yeti. The show begins with the premise that the skiers\' injuries were such that only a creature with superhuman strength could have caused them. The episode concluded with there being no evidence for its claims.\n\n\n=== Other ===\nKeith McCloskey, who has researched the incident for many years and has appeared in several TV documentaries on the subject, travelled to the Dyatlov Pass in 2015 with Yury Kuntsevich of the Dyatlov Foundation and a group. At the Dyatlov Pass he noted:\n\nThere were wide discrepancies in distances quoted between the two possible locations of the snow shelter where Dubinina, Kolevatov, Zolotarev and Thibault-Brignolles were found. One location was approximately 80 to 100 metres from the pine tree where the bodies of Doroshenko and Krivonischenko were found and the other suggested location was so close to the tree that anyone in the snow shelter could have spoken to those at the tree without raising their voices to be heard. This second location also has a rock in the stream where Dubinina\'s body was found and is the more likely location of the two. However, the second suggested location of the two has a topography that is closer to the photos taken at the time of the search in 1959.\nThe location of the tent near the ridge was found to be too close to the spur of the ridge for any significant build-up of snow to cause an avalanche. Furthermore, the prevailing wind blowing over the ridge had the effect of blowing snow away from the edge of the ridge on the side where the tent was. This further reduced any build-up of snow to cause an avalanche. This aspect of the lack of snow on the top and near the top of the ridge was pointed out by Sergey Sogrin in 2010McCloskey also noted: \n\nLev Ivanov\'s boss, Evgeny Okishev (Deputy Head of the Investigative Department of the Sverdlovsk Oblast Prosecution Office), was still alive in 2015 and had given an interview to former Kemerovo prosecutor Leonid Proshkin in which Okishev stated that he was arranging another trip to the Pass to fully investigate the strange deaths of the last four bodies when Deputy Prosecutor General Urakov arrived from Moscow and ordered the case shut down.\nEvgeny Okishev also stated in his interview with Leonid Proshkin that Klinov, head of the Sverdlovsk Prosecutor\'s Office, was present at the first post mortems in the morgue and spent three days there. Something Okishev regarded as highly unusual and the only time, in his experience, it had happened.Donnie Eichar, who investigated and made a documentary about the incident, evaluated several other theories that are deemed unlikely or have been discredited:\nThey were attacked by Mansi or other local tribesmen.The local tribesmen were known to be peaceful and there was no track evidence of anyone approaching the tent.They were attacked and chased by animal wildlife.There were no animal tracks and the group would not have abandoned the relative security of the tent.High winds blew one member away, and the others attempted to rescue the person.A large experienced group would not have behaved like that, and winds strong enough to blow away people with such force would have also blown away the tent.An argument, possibly related to a romantic encounter that left some of them only partially clothed, led to a violent dispute.About this, Eichar states that it is \"highly implausible. By all indications, the group was largely harmonious and sexual tension was confined to platonic flirtation and crushes. There were no drugs present and the only alcohol was a small flask of medicinal alcohol, found intact at the scene. The group had even sworn off cigarettes for the expedition.\" Furthermore, a fight could not have left the massive injuries that one body had suffered.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nPopular interest in Russia was revived in the 1990s in the wake of  Gushchin\'s 1990 novel, The Price of State Secrets Is Nine Lives. In 2000, a regional television company produced the documentary film, with a follow-up novella by Anna Matveyeva. Anna Kiryanova wrote a journal-style novel based on a fictionalized account of the incident in 2005.\nIn 2015 Russian band Kauan released the album Sorni Nai which attempts to reconstruct the events that led up to the incident.The incident came to wider attention in popular media outside of Russia in the 2010s.\n\nAnatoly Guschin (Анатолий Гущин), The Price of State Secrets Is Nine Lives (Цена гостайны – девять жизней), 1990.\nThe Dyatlov Pass Incident (aka Devil\'s Pass), a film directed by Renny Harlin, was released on 28 February 2013 in Russia and 23 August 2013 in the USA. It follows five American students retracing the steps of the victims, but, being a work of fiction, makes several changes in describing the initial events, e.g. inverting names of victims.\nThe incident figures prominently in the 2012 novel City of Exiles by Alec Nevala-Lee.\nRussia\'s Mystery Files: Episode 2 – The Dyatlov Pass Incident, 28 November 2014, National Geographic.\nThe 2015 Polish horror video game Kholat is inspired by the Dead Mountain incident, in which the player goes to Dyatlov Pass in order to trace the steps of the lost expedition, and begins to uncover \"the true cause\" of the hikers\' deaths.\nIn Criminal Minds season 13 episode 21, Agent Matt Simmons (played by Daniel Henney), makes reference to the incident when chasing a serial killer who hears The Hum.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Works cited ==\nEichar, Donnie (2013).

Situated adjacent to North Hudson Park, the building was constructed in 1967 during a high-rise building spree and at 369 feet (112 m) is among the tallest buildings in the area. The 34-story building has 356 apartments and 5 levels of indoor parking.\n\n\n== Stonehenge incident ==\n\nThe \"Stonehenge Incident\" or the \"North Hudson Park UFO sightings\" occurred on January 12, 1975 at approximately 2:45 AM when a UFO was allegedly sighted in North Hudson Park by George O\'Barski. Barski, who was driving home, suddenly heard static over his radio. Through his car window, he saw a dark, round spacecraft with brightly lit windows hovering over the ground. Ten small, hooded, identically dressed figures emerged from the UFO, dug up soil and collected it in bags before returning to the vessel. He returned to the site the next day and found the holes that had been left. Hudson County Police Officers Thomas Feldhan and John Mackanics investigated and filed reports.\nMonths later, O\'Barski relayed the story to an old acquaintance, Budd Hopkins, who was interested in UFOs. Hopkins and two others associated with Center for UFO Studies found independent witnesses, namely the doormen at the Stonehenge, who reported sighting a UFO in park the same time. Hopkins, Ted Bloecher, then director of New York State\'s Mutual UFO Network (MUFON), and Jerry Stoehrer, also of MUFON, investigated the incident, interviewing the witness and taking soil samples. A story about the incident was published in The Village Voice. Hopkins wrote the book, Missing Time, which drew further attention to the incident.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of tallest buildings in North Hudson\nGalaxy Towers\nWOR TV Tower\n\n\n== References ==', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0c/8.7.09BraddockParkByLuigiNovi13.jpg');

(35, 'Unidentified flying objects', 'An unidentified flying object (UFO) is an object observed in the sky that is not readily identified. Most UFOs are later identified as conventional objects or phenomena. The term is widely used for claimed observations of extraterrestrial spacecraft.\n\n\n== Terminology ==\nThe term \"UFO\" (or \"UFOB\") was coined in 1953 by the United States Air Force (USAF) to serve as a catch-all for all such reports. In its initial definition, the USAF stated that a \"UFOB\" was \"any airborne object which by performance, aerodynamic characteristics, or unusual features, does not conform to any presently known aircraft or missile type, or which cannot be positively identified as a familiar object.\"  Accordingly, the term was initially restricted to that fraction of cases which remained unidentified after investigation, as the USAF was interested in potential national security reasons and/or \"technical aspects\" (see Air Force Regulation 200-2).\nDuring the late 1940s and through the 1950s, UFOs were often referred to popularly as \"flying saucers\" or \"flying discs\". The term UFO became more widespread during the 1950s, at first in technical literature, but later in popular use. UFOs garnered considerable interest during the Cold War, an era associated with a heightened concern for national security, and, more recently, in the 2010s, for unexplained reasons. Nevertheless, various studies have concluded that the phenomenon does not represent a threat to national security, nor does it contain anything worthy of scientific pursuit (e.g., 1951 Flying Saucer Working Party, 1953 CIA Robertson Panel, USAF Project Blue Book, Condon Committee).\nThe Oxford English Dictionary defines a UFO as \"An unidentified flying object; a \'flying saucer\'.\" The first published book to use the word was authored by Donald E. Keyhoe.The acronym \"UFO\" was coined by Captain Edward J. Ruppelt, who headed Project Blue Book, then the USAF\'s official investigation of UFOs. He wrote, \"Obviously the term \'flying saucer\' is misleading when applied to objects of every conceivable shape and performance. For this reason the military prefers the more general, if less colorful, name: unidentified flying objects. UFO (pronounced Yoo-foe) for short.\" Other phrases that were used officially and that predate the UFO acronym include \"flying flapjack\", \"flying disc\", \"unexplained flying discs\", and \"unidentifiable object\".The phrase \"flying saucer\" had gained widespread attention after the summer of 1947. On June 24, a civilian pilot named Kenneth Arnold reported seeing nine objects flying in formation near Mount Rainier. Arnold timed the sighting and estimated the speed of discs to be over 1,200 mph (1,931 km/h). At the time, he claimed he described the objects flying in a saucer-like fashion, leading to newspaper accounts of \"flying saucers\" and \"flying discs\".In popular usage, the term UFO came to be used to refer to claims of alien spacecraft, and because of the public and media ridicule associated with the topic, some ufologists and investigators prefer to use terms such as \"unidentified aerial phenomenon\" (UAP) or \"anomalous phenomena\", as in the title of the National Aviation Reporting Center on Anomalous Phenomena (NARCAP). \"Anomalous aerial vehicle\" (AAV) or \"unidentified aerial system\" (UAS) are also sometimes used in a military aviation context to describe unidentified targets.\n\n\n== Studies ==\nStudies have established that the majority of UFO observations are misidentified conventional objects or natural phenomena—most commonly aircraft, balloons, noctilucent clouds, nacreous clouds, or astronomical objects such as meteors or bright planets with a small percentage even being hoaxes. Between 5% and 20% of reported sightings are not explained, and therefore can be classified as unidentified in the strictest sense. While proponents of the extraterrestrial hypothesis (ETH) suggest that these unexplained reports are of alien spacecraft, the null hypothesis cannot be excluded that these reports are simply other more prosaic phenomena that cannot be identified due to lack of complete information or due to the necessary subjectivity of the reports.\nAlmost no scientific papers about UFOs have been published in peer-reviewed journals. There was, in the past, some debate in the scientific community about whether any scientific investigation into UFO sightings is warranted with the general conclusion being that the phenomenon was not worthy of serious investigation except as a cultural artifact. UFOs have been the subject of investigations by various governments who have provided extensive records related to the subject. Many of the most involved government-sponsored investigations ended after agencies concluded that there was no benefit to continued investigation.The void left by the lack of institutional or scientific study has given rise to independent researchers and fringe groups, including the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP) in the mid-20th century and, more recently, the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON) and the Center for UFO Studies (CUFOS). The term \"Ufology\" is used to describe the collective efforts of those who study reports and associated evidence of unidentified flying objects.UFOs have become a prevalent theme in modern culture, and the social phenomena have been the subject of academic research in sociology and psychology.\n\n\n== Early history ==\nUnexplained aerial observations have been reported throughout history. Some were undoubtedly astronomical in nature: comets, bright meteors, one or more of the five planets that can be readily seen with the naked eye, planetary conjunctions, or atmospheric optical phenomena such as parhelia and lenticular clouds. An example is Halley\'s Comet, which was recorded first by Chinese astronomers in 240 BC and possibly as early as 467 BC. Such sightings throughout history often were treated as supernatural portents, angels, or other religious omens. Some current-day UFO researchers have noticed similarities between some religious symbols in medieval paintings and UFO reports though the canonical and symbolic character of such images is documented by art historians placing more conventional religious interpretations on such images.\nOn April 14, 1561, residents of Nuremberg described the appearance of a large black triangular object. According to witnesses, there were also hundreds of spheres, cylinders and other odd-shaped objects that moved erratically overhead.\nOn January 25, 1878, the Denison Daily News printed an article in which John Martin, a local farmer, had reported seeing a large, dark, circular object resembling a balloon flying \"at wonderful speed.\" Martin, according to the newspaper account, said it appeared to be about the size of a saucer, the first known use of the word \"saucer\" in association with a UFO.\nIn April 1897, thousands of people reported seeing \"airships\" in various parts of the United States. Many signed affidavits. Scores of people even reported talking to the pilots. Thomas Edison was asked his opinion, and said, \"You can take it from me that it is a pure fake.\"\nOn February 28, 1904, there was a sighting by three crew members on the USS Supply 300 miles (483 km) west of San Francisco, reported by Lieutenant Frank Schofield, later to become Commander-in-Chief of the Pacific Battle Fleet. Schofield wrote of three bright red egg-shaped and circular objects flying in echelon formation that approached beneath the cloud layer, then changed course and \"soared\" above the clouds, departing directly away from the earth after two to three minutes. The largest had an apparent size of about six Suns, he said.\nThe three earliest known pilot UFO sightings, of 1,305 similar sightings catalogued by NARCAP, took place in 1916 and 1926. On January 31, 1916, a UK pilot near Rochford reported a row of lights, resembling lighted windows on a railway carriage, that rose and disappeared. In January 1926 a pilot reported six \"flying manhole covers\" between Wichita, Kansas, and Colorado Springs, Colorado. In late September 1926 an airmail pilot over Nevada said he had been forced to land by a huge, wingless, cylindrical object.\nOn August 5, 1926, while traveling in the Humboldt Mountains of Tibet\'s Kokonor region, Russian explorer Nicholas Roerich reported, members of his expedition saw \"something big and shiny reflecting the sun, like a huge oval moving at great speed. Crossing our camp the thing changed in its direction from south to southwest. And we saw how it disappeared in the intense blue sky. We even had time to take our field glasses and saw quite distinctly an oval form with shiny surface, one side of which was brilliant from the sun.\" Another description by Roerich was of a \"shiny body flying from north to south. Field glasses are at hand. It is a huge body. One side glows in the sun. It is oval in shape. Then it somehow turns in another direction and disappears in the southwest.\"\nIn the Pacific and European theatres during World War II, \"foo fighters\" (metallic spheres, balls of light and other shapes that followed aircraft) were reported and on occasion photographed by Allied and Axis pilots. Some proposed Allied explanations at the time included St. Elmo\'s fire, the planet Venus, hallucinations from oxygen deprivation, or German secret weapons.\nIn 1946, more than 2,000 reports were collected, primarily by the Swedish military, of unidentified aerial objects over the Scandinavian nations, along with isolated reports from France, Portugal, Italy and Greece. The objects were referred to as \"Russian hail\" and later as \"ghost rockets\" because it was thought that the mysterious objects were possibly Russian tests of captured German V1 or V2 rockets. Although most were thought to be such natural phenomena as meteors, more than 200 were tracked on radar by the Swedish military and deemed to be \"real physical objects.\" In a 1948 top secret document, Swedish authorities advised the USAF Europe that some of their investigators believed these craft to be extraterrestrial in origin.\n\n\n== Investigations ==\nUFOs have been subject to investigations over the years that varied widely in scope and scientific rigor. Governments or independent academics in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Japan, Peru, France, Belgium, Sweden, Brazil, Chile, Uruguay, Mexico, Spain, and the Soviet Union are known to have investigated UFO reports at various times.\nAmong the best known government studies are the ghost rockets investigation by the Swedish military (1946–1947), Project Blue Book, previously Project Sign and Project Grudge, conducted by the USAF from 1947 until 1969, the secret U.S. Army/Air Force Project Twinkle investigation into green fireballs (1948–1951), the secret USAF Project Blue Book Special Report No. 14 by the Battelle Memorial Institute, and the Brazilian Air Force\'s 1977 Operação Prato (Operation Saucer). France has had an ongoing investigation (GEPAN/SEPRA/GEIPAN) within its space agency Centre national d\'études spatiales (CNES) since 1977; the government of Uruguay has had a similar investigation since 1989.\n\n\n=== Project Sign ===\n\nProject Sign in 1948 produced a highly classified finding (see Estimate of the Situation) that the best UFO reports probably had an extraterrestrial explanation. A top secret Swedish military opinion given to the USAF in 1948 stated that some of their analysts believed that the 1946 ghost rockets and later flying saucers had extraterrestrial origins. (For document, see Ghost rockets.) In 1954 German rocket scientist Hermann Oberth revealed that an internal West German government investigation, which he headed, had arrived at an extraterrestrial conclusion, but this study was never made public.\n\n\n=== Project Grudge ===\n\nProject Sign was dismantled and became Project Grudge at the end of 1948. Angered by the low quality of investigations by Grudge, the Air Force Director of Intelligence reorganized it as Project Blue Book in late 1951, placing Ruppelt in charge. Blue Book closed down in 1970, using the Condon Committee\'s negative conclusion as a rationale, thus ending official Air Force UFO investigations. However, a 1969 USAF document, known as the Bolender memo, along with later government documents, revealed that non-public U.S. government UFO investigations continued after 1970. The Bolender memo first stated that \"reports of unidentified flying objects that could affect national security ... are not part of the Blue Book system,\" indicating that more serious UFO incidents already were handled outside the public Blue Book investigation. The memo then added, \"reports of UFOs which could affect national security would continue to be handled through the standard Air Force procedures designed for this purpose.\" In addition, in the late 1960s a chapter on UFOs in the Space Sciences course at the U.S. Air Force Academy gave serious consideration to possible extraterrestrial origins. When word of the curriculum became public, the Air Force in 1970 issued a statement to the effect that the book was outdated and that cadets instead were being informed of the Condon Report\'s negative conclusion.\n\n\n=== USAF Regulation 200-2 ===\nAir Force Regulation 200-2, issued in 1953 and 1954, defined an Unidentified Flying Object (\"UFOB\") as \"any airborne object which by performance, aerodynamic characteristics, or unusual features, does not conform to any presently known aircraft or missile type, or which cannot be positively identified as a familiar object.\" The regulation also said UFOBs were to be investigated as a \"possible threat to the security of the United States\" and \"to determine technical aspects involved.\"  The regulation went on to say that \"it is permissible to inform news media representatives on UFOB\'s when the object is positively identified as a familiar object,\" but added: \"For those objects which are not explainable, only the fact that ATIC [Air Technical Intelligence Center] will analyze the data is worthy of release, due to many unknowns involved.\"\n\n\n=== Project Blue Book ===\n\nJ. Allen Hynek, a trained astronomer who served as a scientific advisor for Project Blue Book, was initially skeptical of UFO reports, but eventually came to the conclusion that many of them could not be satisfactorily explained and was highly critical of what he described as \"the cavalier disregard by Project Blue Book of the principles of scientific investigation.\" Leaving government work, he founded the privately funded CUFOS, to whose work he devoted the rest of his life. Other private groups studying the phenomenon include the MUFON, a grass roots organization whose investigator\'s handbooks go into great detail on the documentation of alleged UFO sightings.\nLike Hynek, Jacques Vallée, a scientist and prominent UFO researcher, has pointed to what he believes is the scientific deficiency of most UFO research, including government studies. He complains of the mythology and cultism often associated with the phenomenon, but alleges that several hundred professional scientists—a group both he and Hynek have termed \"the invisible college\"—continue to study UFOs in private.\n\n\n=== Scientific studies ===\nThe study of UFOs has received little support in mainstream scientific literature. Official studies ended in the U.S. in December 1969, following the statement by the government scientist Edward Condon that further study of UFOs could not be justified on grounds of scientific advancement. The Condon Report and its conclusions were endorsed by the National Academy of Scientists, of which Condon was a member. On the other hand, a scientific review by the UFO subcommittee of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) disagreed with Condon\'s conclusion, noting that at least 30 percent of the cases studied remained unexplained and that scientific benefit might be gained by continued study.\nCritics argue that all UFO evidence is anecdotal and can be explained as prosaic natural phenomena. Defenders of UFO research counter that knowledge of observational data, other than what is reported in the popular media, is limited in the scientific community and that further study is needed.No official government investigation has ever publicly concluded that UFOs are indisputably real, physical objects, extraterrestrial in origin, or of concern to national defense. These same negative conclusions also have been found in studies that were highly classified for many years, such as the UK\'s Flying Saucer Working Party, Project Condign, the U.S. CIA-sponsored Robertson Panel, the U.S. military investigation into the green fireballs from 1948 to 1951, and the Battelle Memorial Institute study for the USAF from 1952 to 1955 (Project Blue Book Special Report No. 14).\nSome public government reports have acknowledged the possibility of physical reality of UFOs, but have stopped short of proposing extraterrestrial origins, though not dismissing the possibility entirely. Examples are the Belgian military investigation into large triangles over their airspace in 1989–1991 and the 2009 Uruguayan Air Force study conclusion (see below).\nSome private studies have been neutral in their conclusions, but argued that the inexplicable core cases call for continued scientific study. Examples are the Sturrock panel study of 1998 and the 1970 AIAA review of the Condon Report.\n\n\n=== United States ===\nU.S. investigations into UFOs include:\n\nThe Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit (IPU), established by the U.S. Army sometime in the 1940s, and about which little is known. In 1987, British UFO researcher Timothy Good received from the Army\'s director of counter-intelligence a letter confirming the existence of the IPU. The letter stated that \"the aforementioned Army unit was disestablished during the late 1950s and never reactivated. All records pertaining to this unit were surrendered to the U.S. Air Force Office of Special Investigations in conjunction with operation BLUEBOOK.\" The IPU records have never been released.\nProject Blue Book, previously Project Sign and Project Grudge, conducted by the USAF from 1947 until 1969\nThe secret U.S. Army/Air Force Project Twinkle investigation into green fireballs (1948–1951)\nGhost rockets investigations by the Swedish, UK, U.S., and Greek militaries (1946–1947)\nThe secret CIA Office of Scientific Investigation (OS/I) study (1952–53)\nThe secret CIA Robertson Panel (1953)\nThe secret USAF Project Blue Book Special Report No. 14 by the Battelle Memorial Institute (1951–1954)\nThe Brookings Report (1960), commissioned by NASA\nThe public Condon Committee (1966–1968)\nThe private, internal RAND Corporation study (1968)\nThe private Sturrock panel (1998)\nThe secret Advanced Aviation Threat Identification Program which was funded from 2007 to 2012.Thousands of documents released under FOIA also indicate that many U.S. intelligence agencies collected (and still collect) information on UFOs. These agencies include the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), FBI, CIA, National Security Agency (NSA), as well as military intelligence agencies of the Army and U.S. Navy, in addition to the Air Force.The investigation of UFOs has also attracted many civilians, who in the U.S formed research groups such as NICAP (active 1956–1980), Aerial Phenomena Research Organization (APRO) (active 1952–1988), MUFON (active 1969–), and CUFOS (active 1973–).\nIn November 2011, the White House released an official response to two petitions asking the U.S. government to acknowledge formally that aliens have visited this planet and to disclose any intentional withholding of government interactions with extraterrestrial beings. According to the response, \"The U.S. government has no evidence that any life exists outside our planet, or that an extraterrestrial presence has contacted or engaged any member of the human race.\" Also, according to the response, there is \"no credible information to suggest that any evidence is being hidden from the public\'s eye.\" The response further noted that efforts, like SETI and NASA\'s Kepler space telescope and Mars Science Laboratory, continue looking for signs of life. The response noted \"odds are pretty high\" that there may be life on other planets but \"the odds of us making contact with any of them—especially any intelligent ones—are extremely small, given the distances involved.\"\n\n\n==== Post-1947 sightings ====\nFollowing the large U.S. surge in sightings in June and early July 1947, on July 9, 1947, United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) intelligence, in cooperation with the FBI, began a formal investigation into selected sightings with characteristics that could not be immediately rationalized, such as Kenneth Arnold\'s. The USAAF used \"all of its top scientists\" to determine whether \"such a phenomenon could, in fact, occur.\" The research was \"being conducted with the thought that the flying objects might be a celestial phenomenon,\" or that \"they might be a foreign body mechanically devised and controlled.\" Three weeks later in a preliminary defense estimate, the air force investigation decided that, \"This \'flying saucer\' situation is not all imaginary or seeing too much in some natural phenomenon. Something is really flying around.\"A further review by the intelligence and technical divisions of the Air Materiel Command at Wright Field reached the same conclusion. It reported that \"the phenomenon is something real and not visionary or fictitious,\" that there were objects in the shape of a disc, metallic in appearance, and as big as man-made aircraft. They were characterized by \"extreme rates of climb [and] maneuverability,\" general lack of noise, absence of trail, occasional formation flying, and \"evasive\" behavior \"when sighted or contacted by friendly aircraft and radar,\" suggesting a controlled craft. It was therefore recommended in late September 1947 that an official Air Force investigation be set up to investigate the phenomenon. It was also recommended that other government agencies should assist in the investigation.\n\n\n==== Project Sign ====\nThis led to the creation of the Air Force\'s Project Sign at the end of 1947, one of the earliest government studies to come to a secret extraterrestrial conclusion. In August 1948, Sign investigators wrote a top-secret intelligence estimate to that effect, but the Air Force Chief of Staff Hoyt Vandenberg ordered it destroyed. The existence of this suppressed report was revealed by several insiders who had read it, such as astronomer and USAF consultant J. Allen Hynek and Capt. Edward J. Ruppelt, the first head of the USAF\'s Project Blue Book.\nAnother highly classified U.S. study was conducted by the CIA\'s Office of Scientific Investigation (OS/I) in the latter half of 1952 in response to orders from the National Security Council (NSC). This study concluded UFOs were real physical objects of potential threat to national security. One OS/I memo to the CIA Director (DCI) in December read: the reports of incidents convince us that there is something going on that must have immediate attention ... Sightings of unexplained objects at great altitudes and traveling at high speeds in the vicinity of major U.S. defense installations are of such a nature that they are not attributable to natural phenomena or any known types of aerial vehicles. The matter was considered so urgent that OS/I drafted a memorandum from the DCI to the NSC proposing that the NSC establish an investigation of UFOs as a priority project throughout the intelligence and the defense research and development community. It also urged the DCI to establish an external research project of top-level scientists, now known as the Robertson Panel to analyze the problem of UFOs. The OS/I investigation was called off after the Robertson Panel\'s negative conclusions in January 1953.\n\n\n==== Condon Committee ====\n\nA public research effort conducted by the Condon Committee for the USAF, which arrived at a negative conclusion in 1968, marked the end of the U.S. government\'s official investigation of UFOs, though various government intelligence agencies continue unofficially to investigate or monitor the situation.Controversy has surrounded the Condon Report, both before and after it was released. It has been observed that the report was \"harshly criticized by numerous scientists, particularly at the powerful AIAA ... [which] recommended moderate, but continuous scientific work on UFOs.\" In an address to the AAAS, James E. McDonald stated that he believed science had failed to mount adequate studies of the problem and criticized the Condon Report and earlier studies by the USAF as scientifically deficient. He also questioned the basis for Condon\'s conclusions and argued that the reports of UFOs have been \"laughed out of scientific court.\" J. Allen Hynek, an astronomer who worked as a USAF consultant from 1948, sharply criticized the Condon Committee Report and later wrote two nontechnical books that set forth the case for continuing to investigate UFO reports.\nRuppelt recounted his experiences with Project Blue Book, a USAF investigation that preceded Condon\'s.\n\n\n==== Notable cases ====\nThe Roswell UFO incident (1947) involved New Mexico residents, local law enforcement officers, and the U.S. military, the latter of whom allegedly collected physical evidence from the UFO crash site.\nThe Mantell UFO incident January 7, 1948\nThe Betty and Barney Hill abduction (1961) was the first reported abduction incident.\nIn the Kecksburg UFO incident, Pennsylvania (1965), residents reported seeing a bell shaped object crash in the area. Police officers, and possibly military personnel, were sent to investigate.\nThe Travis Walton abduction case (1975): The movie Fire in the Sky (1993) was based on this event, but greatly embellished the original account.\nThe \"Phoenix Lights\" March 13, 1997\n2006 O\'Hare International Airport UFO sighting\n\n\n=== Brazil ===\nOn October 31, 2008, the National Archives of Brazil  began receiving from the Aeronautical Documentation and History Center part of the documentation of the Brazilian Air Force regarding the investigation of the appearance of UFOs in Brazil. Currently this collection gathers cases between 1952 and 2016.\n\n\n=== Canada ===\nIn Canada, the Department of National Defence has dealt with reports, sightings and investigations of UFOs across Canada. In addition to conducting investigations into crop circles in Duhamel, Alberta, it still considers \"unsolved\" the Falcon Lake incident in Manitoba and the Shag Harbour UFO incident in Nova Scotia.Early Canadian studies included Project Magnet (1950–1954) and Project Second Storey (1952–1954), supported by the Defence Research Board.\n\n\n=== France ===\nOn March 2007, the French space agency CNES published an archive of UFO sightings and other phenomena online.French studies include GEPAN/SEPRA/GEIPAN (1977–), within CNES (French space agency), the longest ongoing government-sponsored investigation. About 22% of 6000 cases studied remain unexplained. The official opinion of GEPAN/SEPRA/GEIPAN has been neutral, stating on their FAQ page that their mission is fact-finding for the scientific community, not rendering an opinion.  They add they can neither prove nor disprove the Exterrestrial Hypothesis (ETH), but their Steering Committee\'s clear position is that they cannot discard the possibility that some fraction of the very strange 22% of unexplained cases might be due to distant and advanced civilizations. Possibly their bias may be indicated by their use of the terms \"PAN\" (French) or \"UAP\" (English equivalent) for \"Unidentified Aerospace Phenomenon\" (whereas \"UAP\" as normally used by English organizations stands for \"Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon\", a more neutral term).   In addition, the three heads of the studies have gone on record in stating that UFOs were real physical flying machines beyond our knowledge or that the best explanation for the most inexplicable cases was an extraterrestrial one.In 2008, Michel Scheller, president of the Association Aéronautique et Astronautique de France (3AF), created the Sigma Commission. Its purpose was to investigate UFO phenomenon worldwide. A progress report published in May 2010 stated that the central hypothesis proposed by the COMETA report is perfectly credible. In December 2012, the final report of the Sigma Commission was submitted to Scheller. Following the submission of the final report, the Sigma2 Commission is to be formed with a mandate to continue the scientific investigation of UFO phenomenon.The most notable cases of UFO sightings in France include the Valensole UFO incident in 1965, and the Trans-en-Provence Case in 1981.\n\n\n=== Italy ===\nAccording to some Italian ufologists, the first documented case of a UFO sighting in Italy dates back to April 11, 1933, to Varese. Documents of the time show that an alleged UFO crashed or landed near Vergiate. Following this, Benito Mussolini created a secret group to look at it, called Cabinet RS/33.Alleged UFO sightings gradually increased since the war, peaking in 1978 and 2005. The total number of sightings since 1947 are 18,500, of which 90% are identifiable.In 2000, Italian ufologist Roberto Pinotti published material regarding the so-called \"Fascist UFO Files\", which dealt with a flying saucer that had crashed near Milan in 1933 (some 14 years before the Roswell, New Mexico, crash), and of the subsequent investigation by a never mentioned before Cabinet RS/33, that allegedly was authorized by Benito Mussolini, and headed by the Nobel scientist Guglielmo Marconi. A spaceship was allegedly stored in the hangars of the SIAI Marchetti in Vergiate near Milan.Julius Obsequens was a Roman writer who is believed to have lived in the middle of the fourth century AD. The only work associated with his name is the Liber de prodigiis (Book of Prodigies), completely extracted from an epitome, or abridgment, written by Livy; De prodigiis was constructed as an account of the wonders and portents that occurred in Rome between 249 BC-12 BC. An aspect of Obsequens\' work that has inspired much interest in some circles is that references are made to things moving through the sky. These have been interpreted as reports of UFOs, but may just as well describe meteors, and, since Obsequens, probably, writes in the 4th century, that is, some 400 years after the events he describes, they hardly qualify as eye-witness accounts.\n\n\n==== Notable cases ====\nA UFO sighting in Florence, October 28, 1954, followed by a fall of angel hair.\nIn 1973, an Alitalia airplane left Rome for Naples sighted a mysterious round object. Two Italian Air Force planes from Ciampino confirmed the sighting. In the same year there was another sighting at Caselle airport near Turin.\nIn 1978, two young hikers, while walking on Monte Musinè near Turin, saw a bright light; one of them temporarily disappeared and, after a while, was found in a state of shock and with a noticeable scald on one leg. After regaining consciousness, he reported having seen an elongated vehicle and that some strangely shaped beings descended from it. Both the young hikers suffered from conjunctivitis for some time.\nA close encounter reported in September 1978 in Torrita di Siena in the Province of Siena. A young motorist saw in front of him a bright object, two beings of small stature who wore suits and helmets, the two approached the car, and after watching it carefully went back and rose again to the UFO. A boy who lived with his family in a country house not far from there said he had seen at the same time \"a kind of small reddish sun\".\nYet in 1978, there has been also the story of Pier Fortunato Zanfretta, the best known and most controversial case of an Italian alleged alien abduction. Zanfretta said (also with truth serum injected) to have been kidnapped by reptilian-like creatures on the night of 6 December and 7 December while he was performing his job at Marzano, in the municipality of Torriglia in the Province of Genoa; 52 testimonies of the case from other people were collected.\n\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\nThe UK\'s Flying Saucer Working Party published its final report in June 1951, which remained secret for over 50 years. The Working Party concluded that all UFO sightings could be explained as misidentifications of ordinary objects or phenomena, optical illusions, psychological misperceptions/aberrations, or hoaxes. The report stated: \"We accordingly recommend very strongly that no further investigation of reported mysterious aerial phenomena be undertaken, unless and until some material evidence becomes available.\"Eight file collections on UFO sightings, dating from 1978 to 1987, were first released on May 14, 2008, to The National Archives by the Ministry of Defence (MoD). Although kept secret from the public for many years, most of the files have low levels of classification and none are classified Top Secret. 200 files are set to be made public by 2012. The files are correspondence from the public sent to the British government and officials, such as the MoD and Margaret Thatcher. The MoD released the files under the Freedom of Information Act due to requests from researchers. These files include, but are not limited to, UFOs over Liverpool and the Waterloo Bridge in London.On October 20, 2008, more UFO files were released. One case released detailed that in 1991 an Alitalia passenger aircraft was approaching London Heathrow Airport when the pilots saw what they described as a \"cruise missile\" fly extremely close to the cockpit. The pilots believed that a collision was imminent. UFO expert David Clarke says that this is one of the most convincing cases for a UFO he has come across.A secret study of UFOs was undertaken for the Ministry of Defence between 1996 and 2000 and was code-named Project Condign. The resulting report, titled \"Unidentified Aerial Phenomena in the UK Defence Region\", was publicly released in 2006, but the identity and credentials of whomever constituted Project Condign remains classified. The report confirmed earlier findings that the main causes of UFO sightings are misidentification of man-made and natural objects. The report noted: \"No artefacts of unknown or unexplained origin have been reported or handed to the UK authorities, despite thousands of Unidentified Aerial Phenomena reports. There are no SIGINT, ELINT or radiation measurements and little useful video or still IMINT.\" It concluded: \"There is no evidence that any UAP, seen in the UKADR [UK Air Defence Region], are incursions by air-objects of any intelligent (extraterrestrial or foreign) origin, or that they represent any hostile intent.\" A little-discussed conclusion of the report was that novel meteorological plasma phenomenon akin to ball lightning are responsible for \"the majority, if not all\" of otherwise inexplicable sightings, especially reports of black triangle UFOs.\nOn December 1, 2009, the Ministry of Defence quietly closed down its UFO investigations unit. The unit\'s hotline and email address were suspended by the MoD on that date. The MoD said there was no value in continuing to receive and investigate sightings in a release, stating in over fifty years, no UFO report has revealed any evidence of a potential threat to the United Kingdom. The MoD has no specific capability for identifying the nature of such sightings. There is no Defence benefit in such investigation and it would be an inappropriate use of defence resources. Furthermore, responding to reported UFO sightings diverts MoD resources from tasks that are relevant to Defence.\"\nThe Guardian reported that the MoD claimed the closure would save the Ministry around £50,000 a year. The MoD said that it would continue to release UFO files to the public through The National Archives.\n\n\n==== Notable cases ====\nAccording to records released on August 5, 2010, British wartime prime minister Winston Churchill banned the reporting for 50 years of an alleged UFO incident because of fears it could create mass panic. Reports given to Churchill asserted that the incident involved a Royal Air Force (RAF) reconnaissance aircraft returning from a mission in France or Germany toward the end of World War II. It was over or near the English coastline when it was allegedly intercepted by a strange metallic object that matched the aircraft\'s course and speed for a time before accelerating away and disappearing. The aircraft\'s crew were reported to have photographed the object, which they said had \"hovered noiselessly\" near the aircraft, before moving off. According to the documents, details of the coverup emerged when a man wrote to the government in 1999 seeking to find out more about the incident and described how his grandfather, who had served with the RAF in the war, was present when Churchill and U.S. General Dwight D. Eisenhower discussed how to deal with the UFO encounter. The files come from more than 5,000 pages of UFO reports, letters and drawings from members of the public, as well as questions raised in Parliament. They are available to download from The National Archives website.In the April 1957 West Freugh incident in Scotland, named after the principal military base involved, two unidentified objects flying high over the UK were tracked by radar operators. The objects were reported to operate at speeds and perform maneuvers beyond the capability of any known craft. Also significant is their alleged size, which – based on the radar returns – was closer to that of a ship than an aircraft.\nIn the Rendlesham Forest incident of December 1980, U.S. military personnel witnessed UFOs near the air base at Woodbridge, Suffolk, over a period of three nights. On one night the deputy base commander, Colonel Charles I. Halt, and other personnel followed one or more UFOs that were moving in and above the forest for several hours. Col. Halt made an audio recording while this was happening and subsequently wrote an official memorandum summarizing the incident. After retirement from the military, he said that he had deliberately downplayed the event (officially termed \'Unexplained Lights\') to avoid damaging his career. Other base personnel are said to have observed one of the UFOs, which had landed in the forest, and even gone up to and touched it.\n\n\n=== Uruguay ===\nThe Uruguayan Air Force has conducted UFO investigations since 1989 and reportedly analyzed 2,100 cases of which they regard approximately 2% as lacking explanation.\n\n\n=== Astronomer reports ===\nThe USAF\'s Project Blue Book files indicate that approximately 1% of all unknown reports came from amateur and professional astronomers or other users of telescopes (such as missile trackers or surveyors). In 1952, astronomer J. Allen Hynek, then a consultant to Blue Book, conducted a small survey of 45 fellow professional astronomers. Five reported UFO sightings (about 11%). In the 1970s, astrophysicist Peter A. Sturrock conducted two large surveys of the AIAA and American Astronomical Society (AAS). About 5% of the members polled indicated that they had had UFO sightings.\nAstronomer Clyde Tombaugh, who admitted to six UFO sightings, including three green fireballs, supported the Extraterrestrial hypothesis for UFOs and stated he thought scientists who dismissed it without study were being \"unscientific.\" Another astronomer was Lincoln LaPaz, who had headed the Air Force\'s investigation into the green fireballs and other UFO phenomena in New Mexico. LaPaz reported two personal sightings, one of a green fireball, the other of an anomalous disc-like object. (Both Tombaugh and LaPaz were part of Hynek\'s 1952 survey.) Hynek himself took two photos through the window of a commercial airliner of a disc-like object that seemed to pace his aircraft.In 1980, a survey of 1800 members of various amateur astronomer associations by Gert Helb and Hynek for CUFOS found that 24% responded \"yes\" to the question \"Have you ever observed an object which resisted your most exhaustive efforts at identification?\"\n\n\n== Claims of increase in reports ==\nIn 2011, MUFON reported that UFO sightings referred to their offices had increased by 67% over the past three years as of June, 2011. According to MUFON international director Clifford Clift, \"Over the past year, we\'ve been averaging 500 sighting reports a month, compared to about 300 three years ago [67 percent],\".According to the annual survey of reports conducted by Canadian-based UFO research group Ufology Research, reported UFO sightings doubled in Canada between 2011 and 2012.In 2013 the Peruvian government\'s Departamento de Investigación de Fenómenos Aéreos Anómalos (Anomalous Aerial Phenomena Research Department), or \"DIFAA\", was officially reactivated due to an increase in reported sightings. According to Colonel Julio Vucetich, head of the air force\'s aerospace interests division (who himself claims to have seen an \"anomalous aerial object\"), \"On a personal basis, it\'s evident to me that we are not alone in this world or universe.\"In contrast, according to the UK-based Association for the Scientific Study of Anomalous Phenomena (ASSAP), reports of sightings in Britain to their office had declined by 96% from 1988 to 2012.\n\n\n== Identification of UFOs ==\n\nStudies show that after careful investigation, the majority of UFOs can be identified as ordinary objects or phenomena. The most commonly found identified sources of UFO reports are:\n\nAstronomical objects (bright stars, planets, meteors, re-entering man-made spacecraft, artificial satellites, and the Moon)\nAircraft (aerial advertising and other aircraft, missile launches)\nBalloons (toy balloons, weather balloons, large research balloons)\nOther atmospheric objects and phenomena (birds, unusual clouds, kites, flares)\nLight phenomena mirages, Fata Morgana, ball lightning, moon dogs, searchlights and other ground lights, etc.\nHoaxesA 1952–1955 study by the Battelle Memorial Institute for the USAF included these categories as well as a \"psychological\" one.\nAn individual 1979 study by CUFOS researcher Allan Hendry found, as did other investigations, that only a small percentage of cases he investigated were hoaxes (<1 %) and that most sightings were actually honest misidentifications of prosaic phenomena. Hendry attributed most of these to inexperience or misperception.\n\n\n== Claims by military, government, and aviation personnel ==\nSince 2001 there have been calls for greater openness on the part of the government by various persons. In May 2001, a press conference was held at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., by an organization called the Disclosure Project, featuring twenty persons including retired Air Force and FAA personnel, intelligence officers and an air traffic controller. They all gave a brief account of what they knew or had witnessed, and stated that they would be willing to testify to what they had said under oath to a Congressional committee. According to a 2002 report in the Oregon Daily Emerald, Disclosure Project founder Steven M. Greer has gathered 120 hours of testimony from various government officials on the topic of UFOs, including astronaut Gordon Cooper and a Brigadier General.In 2007, former Arizona governor Fife Symington came forward and belatedly claimed that he had seen \"a massive, delta-shaped craft silently navigate over Squaw Peak, a mountain range in Phoenix, Arizona\" in 1997.On September 27, 2010, a group of six former USAF officers and one former enlisted Air Force man held a press conference at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., on the theme \"U.S. Nuclear Weapons Have Been Compromised by Unidentified Aerial Objects.\" They told how they had witnessed UFOs hovering near missile sites and even disarming the missiles.\nFrom April 29 to May 3, 2013, the Paradigm Research Group held the \"Citizen Hearing on Disclosure\" at the National Press Club. The group paid former U.S. Senator Mike Gravel and former Representatives Carolyn Cheeks Kilpatrick, Roscoe Bartlett, Merrill Cook, Darlene Hooley, and Lynn Woolsey $20,000 each to hear testimony from a panel of researchers which included witnesses from military, agency, and political backgrounds.Apollo 14 astronaut Dr Edgar Mitchell claimed that he knew of senior government employees who had been involved in \"close encounters\" and because of this he has no doubt that aliens have visited Earth.\n\n\n== Extraterrestrial hypothesis ==\n\nWhile technically a UFO refers to any unidentified flying object, in modern popular culture the term UFO has generally become synonymous with alien spacecraft; however, the term ETV (ExtraTerrestrial Vehicle) is sometimes used to separate this explanation of UFOs from totally earthbound explanations.\n\n\n== Associated claims ==\nBesides anecdotal visual sightings, reports sometimes include claims of other kinds of evidence, including cases studied by the military and various government agencies of different countries (such as Project Blue Book, the Condon Committee, the French GEPAN/SEPRA, and Uruguay\'s current Air Force study).\nA comprehensive scientific review of cases where physical evidence was available was carried out by the 1998 Sturrock panel, with specific examples of many of the categories listed below.\nRadar contact and tracking, sometimes from multiple sites. These have included military personnel and control tower operators, simultaneous visual sightings, and aircraft intercepts. One such example were the mass sightings of large, silent, low-flying black triangles in 1989 and 1990 over Belgium, tracked by NATO radar and jet interceptors, and investigated by Belgium\'s military (included photographic evidence). Another famous case from 1986 was the Japan Air Lines flight 1628 incident over Alaska investigated by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).\nPhotographic evidence, including still photos, movie film, and video.\nClaims of physical trace of landing UFOs, including ground impressions, burned or desiccated soil, burned and broken foliage, magnetic anomalies, increased radiation levels, and metallic traces. (See, e. g. Height 611 UFO incident or the 1964 Lonnie Zamora\'s Socorro, New Mexico encounter of the USAF Project Blue Book cases.) A well-known example from December 1980 was the USAF Rendlesham Forest incident in England. Another occurred in January 1981 in Trans-en-Provence and was investigated by GEPAN, then France\'s official government UFO-investigation agency. Project Blue Book head Edward J. Ruppelt described a classic 1952 CE2 case involving a patch of charred grass roots.\nPhysiological effects on people and animals including temporary paralysis, skin burns and rashes, corneal burns, and symptoms superficially resembling radiation poisoning, such as the Cash-Landrum incident in 1980.\nAnimal/cattle mutilation cases, that some feel are also part of the UFO phenomenon.\nBiological effects on plants such as increased or decreased growth, germination effects on seeds, and blown-out stem nodes (usually associated with physical trace cases or crop circles)\nElectromagnetic interference (EM) effects. A famous 1976 military case over Tehran, recorded in CIA and DIA classified documents, was associated with communication losses in multiple aircraft and weapons system failure in an F-4 Phantom II jet interceptor as it was about to fire a missile on one of the UFOs.\nApparent remote radiation detection, some noted in FBI and CIA documents occurring over government nuclear installations at Los Alamos National Laboratory and Oak Ridge National Laboratory in 1950, also reported by Project Blue Book director Edward J. Ruppelt in his book.\nClaimed artifacts of UFOs themselves, such as 1957, Ubatuba, Brazil, magnesium fragments analyzed by the Brazilian government and in the Condon Report and by others. The 1964 Lonnie Zamora incident also left metal traces, analyzed by NASA. A more recent example involves a tear drop-shaped object recovered by Bob White and was featured in a television episode of UFO Hunters.\nAngel hair and angel grass, possibly explained in some cases as nests from ballooning spiders or chaff.\n\n\n== Ufology ==\n\nUfology is a neologism describing the collective efforts of those who study UFO reports and associated evidence.\n\n\n=== Researchers ===\n\n\n=== Sightings ===\n\n\n=== Organizations ===\n\n\n=== Categorization ===\nSome ufologists recommend that observations be classified according to the features of the phenomenon or object that are reported or recorded. Typical categories include:\n\nSaucer, toy-top, or disk-shaped \"craft\" without visible or audible propulsion.\nLarge triangular \"craft\" or triangular light pattern, usually reported at night.\nCigar-shaped \"craft\" with lighted windows (meteor fireballs are sometimes reported this way, but are very different phenomena).\nOther: chevrons, (equilateral) triangles, crescent, boomerangs, spheres (usually reported to be shining, glowing at night), domes, diamonds, shapeless black masses, eggs, pyramids and cylinders, classic \"lights.\"Popular UFO classification systems include the Hynek system, created by J. Allen Hynek, and the Vallée system, created by Jacques Vallée.Hynek\'s system involves dividing the sighted object by appearance, subdivided further into the type of \"close encounter\" (a term from which the film director Steven Spielberg derived the title of his 1977 UFO movie, Close Encounters of the Third Kind).\nJacques Vallée\'s system classifies UFOs into five broad types, each with from three to five subtypes that vary according to type.\n\n\n=== Scientific skepticism ===\nA scientifically skeptical group that has for many years offered critical analysis of UFO claims is the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (CSI).\nOne example is the response to local beliefs that \"extraterrestrial beings\" in UFOs were responsible for crop circles appearing in Indonesia, which the government and the National Institute of Aeronautics and Space (LAPAN) described as \"man-made\". Thomas Djamaluddin, research professor of astronomy and astrophysics at LAPAN stated: \"We have come to agree that this \'thing\' cannot be scientifically proven. Scientists have put UFOs in the category of pseudoscience.\"\n\n\n== Conspiracy theories ==\n\nUFOs are sometimes an element of conspiracy theories in which governments are allegedly intentionally \"covering up\" the existence of aliens by removing physical evidence of their presence, or even collaborating with extraterrestrial beings. There are many versions of this story; some are exclusive, while others overlap with various other conspiracy theories.\nIn the U.S., an opinion poll conducted in 1997 suggested that 80% of Americans believed the U.S. government was withholding such information. Various notables have also expressed such views. Some examples are astronauts Gordon Cooper and Edgar Mitchell, Senator Barry Goldwater, Vice Admiral Roscoe H. Hillenkoetter (the first CIA director), Lord Hill-Norton (former British Chief of Defense Staff and NATO head), the 1999 French COMETA study by various French generals and aerospace experts, and Yves Sillard (former director of CNES, new director of French UFO research organization GEIPAN).It has also been suggested by a few paranormal authors that all or most human technology and culture is based on extraterrestrial contact (see also ancient astronauts).\n\n\n== Famous hoaxes ==\n\nThe Maury Island incident\nGeorge Adamski, over the space of two decades, made various claims about his meetings with telepathic aliens from nearby planets. He claimed that photographs of the far side of the Moon taken by the Soviet lunar probe Luna 3 in 1959 were fake, and that there were cities, trees and snow-capped mountains on the far side of the Moon. Among copycats was a shadowy British figure named Cedric Allingham.\nEd Walters, a building contractor, in 1987 allegedly perpetrated a hoax in Gulf Breeze, Florida. Walters claimed at first having seen a small UFO flying near his home and took some photographs of the craft. Walters reported and documented a series of UFO sightings over a period of three weeks and took several photographs. These sightings became famous, and are collectively referred to as the Gulf Breeze UFO incident. Three years later, in 1990, after the Walters family had moved, the new residents discovered a model of a UFO poorly hidden in the attic that bore an undeniable resemblance to the craft in Walters\' photographs. Most investigators, like the forensic photo expert William G. Hyzer, now consider the sightings to be a hoax.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\n\nUFOs have constituted a widespread international cultural phenomenon since the 1950s. Gallup Polls rank UFOs near the top of lists for subjects of widespread recognition. In 1973, a survey found that 95 percent of the public reported having heard of UFOs, whereas only 92 percent had heard of U.S. President Gerald Ford in a 1977 poll taken just nine months after he left the White House. A 1996 Gallup Poll reported that 71 percent of the United States population believed that the U.S. government was covering up information regarding UFOs. A 2002 Roper Poll for the Sci-Fi Channel found similar results, but with more people believing that UFOs are extraterrestrial craft. In that latest poll, 56 percent thought UFOs were real craft and 48 percent that aliens had visited the Earth. Again, about 70 percent felt the government was not sharing everything it knew about UFOs or extraterrestrial life.Another effect of the flying saucer type of UFO sightings has been Earth-made flying saucer craft in space fiction, for example the United Planets Cruiser C57D in Forbidden Planet (1956), the Jupiter 2 in Lost in Space, and the saucer section of the USS Enterprise in Star Trek, and many others.\nUFOs and extraterrestrials have been featured in many movies.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nKenneth Arnold UFO sighting\nKosmopoisk\nList of reported UFO sightings\nMajestic 12\nMystery airship\nPsychosocial hypothesis\nUFO religion\nUfology\nUnidentified submerged object or USO\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n=== General ===\n\n\n=== History ===\n\n\n=== Psychology ===\n\n\n=== Technology ===\n\n\n=== Skepticism ===\n\n\n== External links ==\n\n\"Government Reports on UFOs\" from the Government Information Library at the University of Colorado Boulder\n\"CIA\'s Role in the Study of UFOs, 1947 – 90\" by Gerald K.

(36, 'Roswell, New Mexico', 'Roswell is a city and the seat of Chaves County in the U.S. state of New Mexico. As of the 2010 census it had a population of 48,411, making it the fifth-largest city in New Mexico. It is a center for irrigated farming, dairying, ranching, manufacturing, distribution, and petroleum production. It is also the home of New Mexico Military Institute (NMMI), founded in 1891. Bitter Lake National Wildlife Refuge is located a few miles northeast of the city on the Pecos River. Bottomless Lakes State Park is located 12 miles (19 km) east of Roswell on US 380.\nRoswell is most popularly known for having its name attached to what is now called the Roswell UFO incident, though the crash site of the alleged UFO was some 75 miles (121 km) from Roswell and closer to Corona. The investigation and debris recovery was handled by the local Roswell Army Air Field. Roswell is a popular town for tourists from around the country because of its many alien-themed stores.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe first non-indigenous settlers of the area around Roswell were a group of pioneers from Missouri, who attempted to start a settlement 15 miles (24 km) southwest of what is now Roswell in 1865, but were forced to abandon the site because of a lack of water. It was called Missouri Plaza. It also had many Hispanic people from Lincoln, New Mexico. John Chisum had his famous Jingle Bob Ranch about 5 miles (8 km) from the center of Roswell, at South Spring Acres. At the time, it was the largest ranch in the United States.\nVan C. Smith, a businessman from Omaha, Nebraska, and his partner, Aaron Wilburn, constructed two adobe buildings in 1869 that began what is now Roswell. The two buildings became the settlement\'s general store, post office, and sleeping quarters for paying guests. In 1871, Smith filed a claim with the federal government for the land around the buildings, and on August 20, 1873, he became the town\'s first postmaster. Smith was the son of Roswell Smith, a prominent lawyer in Lafayette, Indiana, and Annie Ellsworth, daughter of U.S. Patent Commissioner Henry Leavitt Ellsworth. He called the town Roswell, after his father\'s first name.\nIn 1877, Captain Joseph Calloway Lea and his family bought out Smith and Wilburn\'s claim and became the owners of most of the land of Roswell and the area surrounding it. The town was relatively quiet during the Lincoln County War (1877–1879). A major aquifer was discovered when merchant Nathan Jaffa had a well drilled in his back yard on Richardson Avenue in 1890, resulting in the area\'s first major growth and development spurt. The growth continued when a railroad was built through town in 1893.\nDuring World War II, a prisoner-of-war camp was located in nearby Orchard Park. The German prisoners of war were used to do major infrastructure work in Roswell, such as paving the banks of the North Spring River. Some POWs used rocks of different sizes to create the outline of an iron cross among the stones covering the north bank. Later, the iron cross was covered with a thin layer of concrete. In the 1980s, a crew cleaning the river bed cleared off the concrete and revealed the outline once more. The small park just south of the cross was then known as Iron Cross Park. On November 11, 1996, the park was renamed POW/MIA Park. The park displays a piece of the Berlin Wall, presented to the city of Roswell by the German Air Force.\nIn the 1930s, Roswell was a site for much of Robert H. Goddard\'s early rocketry work. (The Roswell Museum and Art Center maintains an exhibit which includes a recreation of Goddard\'s rocketry development workshop.)\nRoswell was a location of military importance from 1941 to 1967. In 1967, the Walker Air Force Base was decommissioned. After the closure of the base, Roswell capitalized on its pleasant climate and reinvented itself as a retirement community.\n\nRoswell has benefited from interest in the alleged UFO incident of 1947. It was the report of an object that crashed in the general vicinity in June or July 1947, allegedly an extraterrestrial spacecraft and its alien occupants. Since the late 1970s, the incident has been the subject of intense controversy and of a conspiracy theory regarding a classified program named \"Mogul\". Many UFO proponents maintain that an alien craft was found and its occupants were captured, and that the military then engaged in a cover-up. In recent times, the business community has deliberately sought out tourists interested in UFOs, science fiction, and aliens.\nIn 1978–79 and 2002, Roswell was named one of the All-American cities.\nRoswell hosted the record-breaking skydive by Felix Baumgartner on October 14, 2012.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nRoswell is located in southeastern New Mexico about 7 mi (11 km) west of the Pecos River and some 40 mi (64 km) east of highlands that rise to the Sierra Blanca range. U.S. Routes 70, 285, and 380 intersect in the city. US 70 leads northeast 111 mi (179 km) to Clovis and 117 mi (188 km) west to Alamogordo; US 285 leads north 192 mi (309 km) to Santa Fe and south 76 mi (122 km) to Carlsbad; and US 380 leads east 134 mi (216 km) to Brownfield, Texas, and west 164 mi (264 km) to Socorro, New Mexico.\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, Roswell has a total area of 29.9 square miles (77.5 km2), of which 29.8 square miles (77.3 km2) is land and 0.04 square miles (0.1 km2), or 0.19%, is covered by water.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nRoswell is located in the High Plains and has four very distinct seasons, giving it a BSk or BSh semiarid climate according to the Köppen climate classification. Winters are cold, but usually sunny, and snowfall is a common occurrence. Spring is mild and usually warm, but can still be cold on occasion. Summers are hot (as is common with the High Plains of New Mexico and Colorado) and, quite frequently, the temperature rises above 100 °F, which can be unpleasant. The North American monsoon occurs during the summer, and can bring torrential downpours, severe thunderstorms (with high winds and hail) and sometimes even tornadoes. The rain can provide a cooling relief from the scorching great plains heat. Fall is mild and pleasant, but can be cold. Snow is possible in October and November.\nThe record low in Roswell is −24 °F (−31 °C) on January 11, 1962 and February 8, 1933. The record high is 114 °F (46 °C) on June 27, 1994.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAs of the 2000 census, 45,293 people, 17,068 households, and 11,742 families resided in the city. The population density was 1,565.2 people per square mile (604.3/km²). The 19,327 housing units averaged 667.9 per square mile (257.9/km²). The racial makeup of the city was 70.96% White, 2.47% African American, 1.28% Native American, 0.65% Asian, 21.29% from other races, and 3.31% from two or more races. Hispanics or Latinos of any race were 44.34% of the population.\nOf the 17,069 households, 34.5% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 49.1% were married couples living together, 14.9% had a female householder with no husband present, and 31.2% were not families. About 27.1% of all households were made up of individuals, and 13.4% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.58 and the average family size was 3.13.\nIn the city, the population was distributed as 28.5% under the age of 18, 9.9% from 18 to 24, 24.9% from 25 to 44, 20.6% from 45 to 64, and 16.0% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 35 years. For every 100 females, there were 93.1 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 88.7 males.\nThe median income for a household in the city was $27,252, and for a family was $31,724. Males had a median income of $26,554 versus $21,408 for females. The per capita income for the city was $14,589. About 18.7% of families and 22.6% of the population were below the poverty line, including 31.1% of those under age 18 and 13.8% of those age 65 or over.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== Public schools ===\nRoswell Independent School District\nGoddard High School\nRoswell High School\nRoswell Job Corps\nNew Mexico Military Institute includes four-year high school and two-year associate college degree programs.\nEastern New Mexico University – Roswell offers four-year college degree programs.\nMountain View Middle School\nMesa Middle School\nSierra Middle School\nBerrendo Middle School\n\n\n=== Private schools ===\nAll Saints Catholic School, a pre-K through eighth-grade Catholic school\nGateway Christian School, a pre-K through high school parochial school (statistics)\nValley Christian Academy, a first grade through high school \"interdenominational Christian school\" (parochial, closed 2015)\n\n\n=== Colleges and universities ===\nEastern New Mexico University-Roswell is a branch of Eastern New Mexico University (headquartered in Portales).

(37, 'UFO sightings in Mexico', 'This is a list of alleged sightings of unidentified flying objects or UFOs in Mexico.\n\n\n== 1883 ==\n\nOn August 12, 1883, the astronomer José Bonilla reported that he saw \"more than 300 dark, unidentified objects crossing before the Sun\" while observing sunspot activity at Zacatecas Observatory in Mexico. He took a number of wet plate photographs at 1/100th of a second exposure. Although it was later found that the objects were actually high-flying geese, Bonilla is usually given the distinction of having taken the earliest photo of an \"unidentified flying object\", with some UFOlogical literature interpreting the photographs as either alien spacecraft or an unsolved mystery.\n\n\n== 1974 ==\nAccording to UFOlogists, local residents reported a mid-air collision between a UFO and a small airplane near the town of Coyame on August 25, 1974 followed by a military investigation and cover up. However historians say that such \"UFO reports\" were likely prompted by the 1974 crash and military recovery of a Cessna aircraft involved in drug trafficking.\n\n\n== 2004 ==\nOn Friday, March 5, Mexican Air Force pilots using infrared equipment to search for drug-smuggling aircraft recorded 11 unidentified objects over southern Campeche. Mexico’s Defense Department issued a press release on May 12 accompanied by videotape that showed moving bright lights at 11,500 feet. Mexican UFOlogist Jaime Maussan interpreted the videotape as \"proof of alien visitation\", but science writer and skeptic Michael Shermer was critical of witness accounts that \"varied wildly\", saying, \"it was like a fisherman\'s tale, growing with each retelling\", while other experts suggested the lights were most likely burn-off flares on offshore  oil platforms in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of reported UFO sightings\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMUFON - Last 20 UFO Sightings and Pictures', ''),
(38, 'Petrozavodsk phenomenon', 'The Petrozavodsk phenomenon was a series of celestial events of a disputed nature that occurred on September 20, 1977. The sightings were reported over a vast territory, from Copenhagen and Helsinki in the west to Vladivostok in the east. It is named after the city of Petrozavodsk in Russia (then in the Soviet Union), where a glowing object was widely reported that showered the city with numerous rays.\nGovernment officials from northern European countries sent letters to Anatoly Aleksandrov, president of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR, expressing concern about whether the observed phenomenon was caused by Soviet weapons testing and whether it constituted a threat to the region’s environment. Since 1977, the phenomenon has been often (though not universally) attributed to the launch of the Soviet satellite Kosmos-955. In the same year, a preliminary report for the Academy of Sciences of the USSR contained an immense body of visual observations, radiolocation reports, physical measurements, and accompanying meteorological data. It concluded that \"based on the available data, it is unfeasible to satisfactorily understand the observed phenomenon\". The Petrozavodsk phenomenon contributed to the creation of Setka AN, a Soviet research program for anomalous atmospheric phenomena.\n\n\n== Name ==\nIn the early Soviet reports the Petrozavodsk phenomenon was referred to as the phenomenon of 20 September 1977. Later it became known as the Petrozavodsk phenomenon. Sometimes it is also called the Petrozavodsk incident or the Petrozavodsk miracle. The phrase \"unidentified flying object\" in the Soviet Union was substituted by the term \"anomalous phenomenon\" for research purposes.\n\n\n== Sightings ==\nMost sightings occurred between 1:00 and 1:20 a.m. UTC, when at least 48 unidentified objects reportedly appeared in the atmosphere. Several sightings occurred before, at 1:00a.m. local time over Medvezhyegorsk, at 2:30 a.m. over Loukhi and at 3:00 a.m. over Kovdor and Palanga (Lithuania). From approximately 3:00 to 3:25 a.m. an unidentified luminous object was observed by the supervising personnel of the Leningrad maritime trade port. At 3:30 a.m. a flying object, surrounded by a luminous coat, was reportedly seen by the crew of the Soviet fishing vessel Primorsk, which was departing from the Primorsk harbour. The object appeared to move noiselessly from the east, and near Primorsk it abruptly changed its direction to north.In Helsinki, Finland, the sightings of a glowing ball were reported by newspapers Ilta-Sanomat on September 20 and  Kansan Uutiset the next day. The ball was observed by many residents, including taxi drivers, police functionaries and Helsinki Airport personnel. An unidentified object was also observed near Turku by two men. At the distance of 300 m they spotted a spinning object similar to a lifebuoy, 10 m in diameter. This claim was contested by Pekka Teerikorpi from Tuorla Observatory. Arguing that the entire phenomenon was caused by Kosmos-955, Teerikorpi believed that the actual distance was \"many hundreds of kilometres\" and that \"such reports probably are due to the well-known fact that it is difficult to estimate distances of unfamiliar phenomena\". Ilta-Sanomat also reported a sighting of a glowing object in Denmark, over Copenhagen, by the pilots of a Finnish airline aircraft flying from Rome.The glowing objects were also observed in various places of the Soviet Union, mostly in the northwest. The appearance of an unidentified object over Helsinki reportedly caused heavy radiotraffic on Soviet territory. In the European part of the Soviet Union \"bright, luminous bodies surrounded by extended shells and emitting light rays or jets of quaint shapes\" were reported. The \"shells\" reportedly \"transformed and diffused within 10 to 15 minutes\", while \"a more longlived, stable glow was observed, mostly in the northeastern part of the sky\". The eyewitnesses included paramedics, on-duty militsiya functionaries, seamen and the longshoremen at Petrozavodsk’s port, military, local airport staff and an amateur astronomer. The phenomenon was also observed by the members of the IZMIRAN geophysical expedition near Lekhta. In Saint Petersburg, then Leningrad, the sighting of an unidentified object was reported by three nightshift employees of Pulkovo Airport, including air traffic controller B. Blagirev. According to Blagirev, he spotted a fireball-like object slightly larger than Venus at 3:55 a.m. in the north-north-east at an azimuth of 10°. The object was surrounded by a spacious, rhythmically glowing coat with intricate structure and \"the observed phenomenon had nothing similar to aurora\". The object moved ascendantly to the observer, to the south-south-west, then it changed the direction to north-north-west and eventually disappeared. All three airport employees failed to identify what they saw. Further reports in the Soviet Union came from Primorsk (two eyewitnesses), Petrodvorets (one eyewitness), Lomonosov (three eyewitnesses), Podporozhye (three eyewitnesses), Polovina (one eyewitness), Leppäsyrjä (one eyewitness), Kem (several eyewitnesses), Põltsamaa, Liiva, Priozersk, Kestenga, Valday and other places. Many reports were accompanied by drawings from eyewitnesses. By 30 December, 1978, the Soviet researchers collected a total of 85 reports on the Petrozavodsk phenomenon.In the settlement of Kurkijoki a luminous object was seen by engineer A. Novozhilov, who compared it to an airship. He reported the sighting to the  candidate of technical sciences, Konstantin Polevitsky, who recorded it. Initially Novozhilov saw what he thought to be a meteor. After some time the object had stopped and then moved towards Novozhilov, quickly increasing in size and acquiring the well-outlined shape of an airship. The object was faceted and tipped with brightly shining spots on front and back. The edges were glowing with white light, which was slightly fainter than spots. The facets resembled windows lit from inside and were evenly glowing with a white light that was fainter than that of the edges. The object reportedly moved at an altitude of 300–500 m, being 100 m long and 12–15 m in diameter. Still approaching Novozhilov, the object, moving from west to east, had released a brightly shining ball from the rear, which flew north. The ball was flying horizontally and then descended behind a forest. The landing reportedly caused the appearance of a bright glow.  At 4:15 a.m. Novozhilov took three unsuccessful photos of the sighting with a 0.1 sec exposure. The object was \"much larger than moon\" and moved with the speed of a helicopter. The observation lasted 10–15 minutes in complete silence.Another detailed account on one unidentified object was given by Soviet writer and philosopher Yuri Linnik. He observed the object on his dacha near Namoyevo at about 3:00 a.m. through an amateur telescope with an 80× magnification. That lens-like object, surrounded by a dim, translucent ring, had a color of a \"dark amethyst, intensively lightened from inside\". The edges of the lens-like object had 16 spots (described by Linnik as \"nozzles\") which emitted pulsating red rays at an angle of 10°–15°. The angular size of the object was estimated at 20 arcminutes. The object passed near stars Gamma Geminorum, Eta Geminorum, Capella, 172 Camelopardalis, 50 Cassiopeiae, Gamma Cephei, Psi Draconis, 16 Draconis, Psi Herculis, Kappa Coronae Borealis and Delta Coronae Borealis. The object stopped near Gamma Cephei at an azimuth of 220°. Near Kappa Coronae Borealis, at an azimuth of 340°–350° the object changed its direction to 30°–35° west. It finally disappeared on the north at an azimuth of 340°. The duration of the flight was 15 minutes.Apart from ground observations, there were also reports from several aircraft. The crew of a Tu-154 spotted a luminous spherical object at an altitude of 12 km. A bright, luminous object was also observed for a half an hour by Georgian writer Guram Pandzhikidze and other passengers of an aircraft returning from Singapore to Moscow at an altitude of 11 km, at about 4:30 or 5:00 a.m. Pandzhikidze reported the sighting on 2 October to the director of Karelian Hydrometeorological Observatory Yuri Gromov, who verified the report\'s copy.\n\n\n=== Petrozavodsk object ===\nAt the time Petrozavodsk was the capital and a major industrial hub of the Karelian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, with a population of 203,000 in 1974. The earliest published report of the Petrozavodsk phenomenon was written by TASS correspondent Nikolai Milov, who described the unidentified object over Petrozavodsk as \"a huge star\", that \"flared up in the dark sky\" at about 4:00 a.m. local time, \"impulsively sending shafts of light to the Earth\". Milov\'s report was published in the mainstream Soviet press (Pravda, Izvestiya, Selskaya Zhizn, and Sotsialisticheskaya Industriya). A local newspaper, Leninskaya Pravda, also reported the Petrozavodsk object. The preliminary data analysis by the Academy of Sciences of the USSR in 1977 found the eyewitness\' reports to be mutually consistent and complementary. Some eyewitness\'s accounts were attested by Yuri Gromov. According to Milov, \"the star\" was spreading out over Petrozavodsk in the form of a jellyfish, \"showering the city with a multitude of very fine rays which created an image of pouring rain\". Milov further reported that \"after some time the luminescent rays ceased\" and \"the jellyfish turned into a bright semicircle\", which resumed its movement towards Onega Lake.The object, surrounded by a translucent coat, was initially spotted at about 4:00 a.m. in the northeastern part of the sky below Ursa Major at an azimuth of about 40°. The initial brightness of the object was \"apparently comparable to that of Venus\". The object moved ascendantly towards Ursa Major. The course angle as determined by former pilot and eyewitness V. Barkhatov was 240°. As the object ascended, it was expanding and pulsating, but a decrease in brightness was not noted. The object moved slowly for about three minutes. Shortly before the object stopped it dispersed a bright \"cloud\". The cloud was round or oval in shape. Its maximum angular size was larger than that of Ursa Major, about 30° in diameter. The altitude of the object during the formation of the \"cloud\" was estimated at 7.5±0.4 km (based on eyewitnesses\' observations) or at 6.0±0.5 km, based on parallax. The linear diameter of the object\'s core was estimated either at 119 or at about 60 m. The diameter of the object\'s jellyfish-like cupola was estimated by Felix Ziegel at about 105 m, based on the drawing of eyewitness Andrei Akimov. The object itself was red in color and emitted a bluish white glow. The lighting of the area was compared to that from a full moon. According to eyewitness V. Trubachev, \"the ground was lightened like in the white night\". The glowing \"cloud\" then developed a dark spot around the central core. The spot was quickly expanding while the glow was fading away. The object hovered over Petrozavodsk for five minutes and then moved away. Before hovering the object moved slowly, with the angular velocity of a passenger aircraft. After the hovering its speed had increased. One eyewitness noted that the object\'s underside resembled a Segner wheel. The entire phenomenon lasted 10–15 minutes. The Petrozavodsk object was also seen in adjacent places, such as Pryazha. In 1978, Tekhnika i Nauka published the colored reconstruction of various stages of the object.\nIn November, 1977, clinician psychologist Y. Andreyeva evaluated the mental condition of nine eyewitnesses of the Petrozavodsk phenomenon. She concluded that \"one can be confident of complete mental sanity of the eyewitnesses and the veracity of their answers and testimonies\". Nonetheless, several reports noted some impact of the phenomenon on humans and environment. According to A. Grakov, who observed a glowing yellow ball the size of a moon, the air above the lake in Petrozavodsk glowed with white light after the ball had disappeared. The glow was more intense than that from Petrozavodsk\'s lights. According to Yuri Linnik, after 20 September 1977 there was increased biological activity in the areas where the phenomenon was observed. Noting that that increase might not be related to the Petrozavodsk phenomenon, Linnik nonetheless reported the blooming of roses in his garden and the second bloom of \"about 10 species of herbaceous plants\". Linnik called it \"extraordinary for Karelia\'s latitude\" because \"after the autumn equinox the vegetation of herbs almost ceases\". He further emphasized the intense bloom of the water in Ukshozero, caused by Ankistrodesmus, shortly after 20 September. Some impact on technical devices was also noted when the engineers in the Petrozavodsk area had reportedly observed \"huge failures\" in computing devices, which then regained normal performance.\n\n\n== Instrumental detection ==\nThe unidentified objects over the airports of Helsinki, Pulkovo and Peski were not detected by the airport radars. Although, according to UPI, the object was detected by the Helsinki airport radar, the airport\'s traffic controller Ari Hämäläinen claimed it was not. The objects were not spotted by the Soviet air defense system either. Later, however, the glowing objects were reportedly detected by the weather radar of Karelian Hydrometeorological Observatory in Petrozavodsk on 30 September at 5:40 p.m., 20 October at 11:30 p.m. and 20 November at 2:14–02:17 a.m.\n\n\n== Soviet investigation ==\n\nThe initial analysis of the phenomenon was made by the research fellow of Sternberg Astronomical Institute Lev Gindilis using various testimonies and meteorological data available by 30 September 1977. He wrote that the passage of one object at a reasonably high altitude, which allows simultaneous observations from all reported locations, is plausible at a flight altitude of c. 100 km or more. Gindilis noted that in that case \"the minimal linear dimensions of the bright spherical object should be about 1 kilometer, while the diameter of the coat – several tens of kilometers\". Considering the launch of Kosmos-955 as the possible cause, Gindilis outlined several obstacles, such as the westward motion of the unidentified object (while Kosmos-955 was launched to the north-east), the observed angular sizes of it combined with the expected distance and prolonged hanging over Leppäsyrjä. On 8 October 1977 a Sortavala newspaper Krasnoye Znamya published a report from a local hydrometeostation, which further confirmed that the Petrozavodsk object moved from northeast to southwest. The suggestion about Kosmos-955 was also criticized by Felix Ziegel, who noted that the space vehicles are launched eastwards, in the direction of Earth\'s rotation.Further in 1977, a for official use only preliminary report on the Petrozavodsk phenomenon was prepared by Gindilis, MEPI engineer-physicist D. Menkov and I. Petrovskaya. It used various data available by 20 October, but the findings were inconclusive. Assuming that \"the extent of phenomenon is apparently too big to be explained by technical experiments on satellite orbits\", the report conjectured \"a possible influence of some cosmic agent\". The report was used at the dedicated meeting on the Petrozavodsk phenomenon, arranged on 1 November 1977 in the Institute of Space Studies of Soviet Academy of Sciences (now Russian Space Research Institute). The findings were also inconclusive.\nOn 2 January, 1978, the vice president of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, Vladimir Kotelnikov, signed a note to the Karelian Department of the Academy, informing about the dispatch of an expert group to study the phenomenon in situ. There, relying on eyewitnesses\' testimonies, the employee of Petrozavodsk University Y. Mezentsev conducted theodolite measurements to determine the approximate location of the unidentified object over Petrozavodsk. In the end of January 1978 the Soviet researchers compiled an appendix to the 1977 preliminary report, which contained updated data on the phenomenon. The appendix further emphasized that the sightings of unidentified objects elsewhere were reported before the launch of Kosmos-955.One copy of the report was received by the French research group GEPAN. The copy was subsequently forwarded to CUFOS in Evanston, Illinois in the United States. J. Allen Hynek presented another copy to NASA scientist Richard Haines, who then translated the copy to English on a government grant. The Soviet report was met with a mixed reception abroad. Haines, Hynek and others publicly claimed that the report was the key evidence for the existence of unidentified flying objects. James Oberg criticised the Soviet investigation, regarding it \"a ruse, possibly another Soviet attempt to divert attention from the truth about Soviet UFOs\".\n\n\n== Proposed explanations ==\n\nSeveral proposals to explain the nature of the phenomenon have been argued. The director of the Pulkovo Observatory Vladimir Krat initially thought that the phenomenon was caused by the fall of a meteorite. Later in public speeches he attributed the phenomenon to aurorae. This view was supported by the director of IZMIRAN Vladimir Migulin, whose conjecture was published in the newspaper Sovetskaya Rossiya on 19 April 1980.  Migulin\'s explanation was rejected by Felix Ziegel, who noted that aurorae cannot occur at an altitude lower than 100 km and that their surface brightness is low, being incomparable to that of the Petrozavodsk object. Later Migulin suggested that the phenomenon occurred \"due to a rare concourse of various circumstances, that is the launch of the satellite Kosmos-955, the strong magnetic perturbation due to solar flare and our scientific experiment of influencing the ionosphere with low frequency radio waves\".In the interview, published in 1977 by Kansan Uutiset and Uusi Suomi, the employee of Nurmijärvi geophysical observatory Matti Kivinen assumed that an unidentified object over Finland could be the remnant of a launch vehicle or satellite. James Oberg attributed the Petrozavodsk object to the launch of the Soviet satellite Kosmos-955 from Plesetsk Cosmodrome, which took place on September 20 at about 3:58 local time. According to James Oberg, because Kosmos-955 was launched in the north-eastern direction, the residents of Petrozavodsk (located to the south-west from Plesetsk) observed the blaze trail from the satellite\'s nozzles, which caused the phenomenon. Oberg\'s view was endorsed particularly by the IZMIRAN fellow Yuli Platov in 1984. According to Platov, the appearance of a shining spot was associated with the flare of the satellite\'s engine. The formation of an extended glowing area reportedly coincided with the satellite\'s leaving the Earth\'s shadow. Similar phenomena (given the name \"space jellyfish\") following the launch of satellites near dawn or dusk have been reported multiple times since the Petrozavodsk incident. Platov further linked the development of the radiant structure to the passage of Kosmos-955 through the turbopause boundary, \"above which the scattering of combustion products occurs without the damping effect of the atmosphere\". In 1985 Platov\'s view was published by Soviet magazine Nauka v SSSR. In a later article Platov noted that \"a number of additional effects, that accompanied the Petrozavodsk phenomenon, was associated with the unsuccessful test launch of a ballistic missile, that was conducted in the same region almost at the same time\". Nonetheless, since the inconclusive Soviet investigation, the Kosmos-955 argument remains contested. Referring to his 18-year service experience at Kapustin Yar site, Ukrainian researcher Oleh Pruss said: \"I know firsthand, what a spectacular in the sky occurs during the rocket launches – it\'s quite an impressive view. However, there was something completely different over Petrozavodsk\".In 1978 Aviatsiya i Kosmonavtika published an article \"\'Flashes\' in the atmosphere\" by M. Dmitriyev, where a chemiluminescence hypothesis was put forward. According to Dmitriyev, the phenomenon was \"neither the result of technical experiments nor a mirage\", but a chemiluminescent area in the atmosphere. Concerning that hypothesis Ziegel wrote, that \"the energy output of chemiluminescence is negligible\", unlike that of the Petrozavodsk object, and that the conjectured chemiluminescent clouds cannot soar against the wind, which the Petrozavodsk object appeared to do.\n\n\n== Note ==\n\n\n== References ==', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/93/TASS_on_Kosmos-955.jpg');

(39, 'Wales UFO sightings', 'This is a list of notable alleged sightings of unidentified flying objects or UFOs in the UK. Many more sightings have become known since the gradual release of the MoD UFO sighting reports by the National Archives in 2008. In recent years there have been many sightings of groups of slowly moving lights in the night sky, which can be easily explained as Chinese lanterns. Project Condign, undertaken from 1997 to 2000, concluded that all the investigated sightings of unidentified aerial phenomena in the U.K. could be assigned to misidentified but explicable objects, or poorly understood natural phenomena.\n\n\n== 12th century ==\n1113: Religious pilgrims in southwest England reported seeing a glowing fire-belching \"dragon\" emerge from the sea, flying into the air, and disappearing into the sky.\n\n\n== 13th century ==\nJanuary 1254: In St. Albans, England, a scribe wrote of a glowing floating light, thus recorded it, \"...in serene sky and clear air, with stars shining and the Moon eight days old, there suddenly appeared in the sky a kind of large ship elegantly shaped, well equipped and of marvelous color.\"\n1290: Friars of Byland Abbey, described of \"a flat, round shining silvery object\" flying overhead of them.\n\n\n== 20th century ==\nFebruary 1942: A woman named Eileen Arnold was walking down Cheltenham high street when she suddenly experienced an altered state of consciousness as she became \"tuned into another reality\". She became aware of a large oval shape moving slowly above the rooftops.  She stated that it radiated light from holes in its side and had quills which detached one by one, also emitting light.  Following this, Eileen believed she had numerous psychic experiences.\nSeptember 1942: Albert Lancaster believes he was abducted by aliens while working as a guard at a radar site near Newbiggin-on-Sea, Northumbria. He claimed to have a sudden urge to go outside followed by a \"strange impulse to look at the sky.\" He claims he saw a glowing light surrounded by dark mist and, assuming it was a German weapon, went to raise the alarm before being struck by a beam of light from the cloud followed by a floating sensation then becoming aware he was back at his post.  Following this experience he believed he had psychic powers for a period of time.\n5 August 1944: According to records released on 5 August 2010, British wartime prime minister Winston Churchill banned the reporting for 50 years of an alleged UFO incident because of fears it could create mass panic.  Reports given to Churchill claimed the incident allegedly involved a Royal Air Force (RAF) reconnaissance plane returning from a mission in France or Germany toward the end of the Second World War. It was over or near the English coastline when it was allegedly suddenly intercepted by a strange metallic object that matched the aircraft\'s course and speed for a time before accelerating away and disappearing.  The plane\'s crew were reported to have photographed the object, which they said had \"hovered noiselessly\" near the aircraft, before moving off.  According to the documents, details of the cover-up emerged when the man wrote to the government in 1999 seeking to find out more about the incident. He described how his grandfather, who served with the RAF in the Second World War, was present when Churchill and U.S. General Dwight Eisenhower discussed how to deal with the UFO encounter.  The files come from more than 5,000 pages of UFO reports and letters and drawings from members of the public, as well as questions raised by Members of Parliament in the Parliament of the United Kingdom.  They are available to download for free for a month from The National Archives website.\n1 June 1950: A Gloster Meteor at RAF Tangmere passes a flying saucer lit up with lights; this was described as \'Britain\'s first flying saucer\'. The object was reported to be shining, revolving, and disc-like at 20,000 ft at 14.30, flying eastwards over the Portsmouth area. RAF Tangmere asked the radar station at RAF Wartling in Sussex if it had seen the object, and it had on its PPI screen. It led to the setting up of the Flying Saucer Working Party.\n14 August 1950: A 50 ft-diameter disc UFO is seen over the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE) at 11.27 by an experienced pilot F/Lt. Hubbard. He claimed to see another similar object on 5 September 1950 at 16.09.\n14–25 September 1952: Operation Mainbrace - many UFOs were observed. On 19 September at 11 am a silver disc-shaped object followed a Gloster Meteor returning to RAF Topcliffe, and seen by observers on the ground. It rotated whilst hovering. It then travelled towards the west at high speed. On 21 September, six RAF planes followed a spherical object over the North Sea. It followed one of the planes back to the base. It was the front-page headline on 20 September 1952 on the Yorkshire Evening Press and on 21 September 1952 on the Sunday Dispatch\n21 October 1952: Two RAF pilots in a Gloster Meteor see three disc-shaped objects at 35,000 ft in the Little Rissington UFO incident.\n3 November 1953: Terry Johnson and Geoffrey Smythe in an RAF de Havilland Vampire saw a UFO over RAF West Malling.\n14 October 1954: Flt Lt James Salandin of the Royal Auxiliary Air Force, flying in a No. 604 Squadron RAF Gloster Meteor F8 from RAF North Weald, narrowly missed two UFOs over Southend-on-Sea at around 4:30 pm at 16,000 ft. The objects were circular with one being coloured silver and the other gold. He narrowly avoided having a head-on collision with the silver object.\n17 July 1955 at noon: on King Harold\'s Way in Bexleyheath in the London Borough of Bexley a 30-foot-wide saucer-shaped object was seen to hover a few feet above a street in broad daylight by Margaret Fry and her doctor on a very hot cloudless day. Car engines nearby to the object stalled. It was seen by around thirty people and made a humming noise and landed at the junction of Ashbourne Road and Whitfield Road. It hovered over Bedonwell Primary School (now Bedonwell Junior School) for around one minute. It finally shot off into the sky. Another UFO had landed a few streets away at the same time. A similar object had been seen in Bexleyheath in 1952.\n13 August 1956: Lakenheath-Bentwaters incident - 12 to 15 objects were picked up by USAF radar over East Anglia. One object was tracked at more than 4,000 mph by USAF GCA radar at RAF Bentwaters. The objects sometimes travelled in formation, then converged to form a larger object and performed sharp turns. One object was tracked for 26 miles which then hovered for five minutes then flew off. One object at 10 pm was tracked at 12,000 mph. RAF de Havilland Venoms from RAF Waterbeach had sightings of the objects.\n22 September 1956 at 3 pm: a large, spherical glass-like 80-foot-diameter object was seen over the Cleethorpes coast for over an hour and also seen on radar from RAF Manby. RAF planes approached the object and it flew off.\n4 April 1957: West Freugh incident - a large object was seen on radar at RAF West Freugh near Stranraer at 50,000 ft which was stationary for 10 minutes over the Irish Sea. It moved vertically to 70,000 ft and was also tracked by radar at Ardwell. The object did an \'impossible\' sharp turn and was described as being as large as a ship, bigger than a normal aircraft.\n20 May 1957: Milton Torres 1957 UFO Encounter - a USAF F-86D Sabre based at RAF Manston intercepted an object over East Anglia.\nLate spring (from 19 May) and early summer 1965: Many sightings of UFOs were seen in the Warminster area. Cley Hill, near to the town, has since been a place for frequent sightings.\n28 April 1967: a dome-shaped object was sighted over Brixham in Devon at around 1,600 ft at around noon for approximately one hour. A door was seen in the side of the object and it had been seen by the HM Coastguard station at Berry Head. There were 362 UFO sightings in 1967: there had only been 95 in 1966.\n1967: Clapham Wood experienced a rash of UFO sightings and unexplained events during the 1960s and continuing into the 1970s.\n24 October 1967: Devon Flying Cross UFO - PCs Roger Willey (from Okehampton) and Clifford Waycott (from Winkleigh) were driving from Holsworthy to Hatherleigh along the A3072 at 4 am. They saw a bright object in the shape of a cross at tree-top height at a distance of about 40 metres. They followed the \'pulsating\' object for about fifteen minutes along the road at speeds up to 80 mph. The object was described as being star-spangled like \'looking through wet glass\'. At 4:23 am it was joined by a second object. A motorist, Mr Christopher Garner of Hatherleigh, had also seen it and thought he was having a nightmare. The object disappeared around 5 am having been followed for fourteen miles. It was attributed to Venus as were other similar sightings that same month.\n25 October 1967: Sussex flying cross - policemen in five police cars across East Sussex reported a bright flying cross in the early hours, with the first sighting at 4:45 am at Halland. The other sightings were a few minutes later.\n26 October 1967: 54-year-old Mr Angus Brooks, a former BOAC administrator for its Comet fleet, of Owermoigne was walking on Moigns Down at 11:25 am near Holworth close to the Dorset coast (a mile south of Owermoigne on the A354) with his two dogs in a force 8 gale and took shelter in a hollow. He then saw a circular translucent craft with a \'girder\' to the front and three \'girders\' pointing to the rear. The girders rearranged to form a cross shape around the central 25 ft diameter disc and then began to spin. Twenty two minutes later, the \'girders\' went back to their original position and the craft sped off in a north-east direction.\n8 September 1970: William Schaffner intercepted an unknown object over the North Sea. His BAC Lightning was later retrieved from the sea.\n1971: It is claimed that unidentified silent craft were regularly seen by two school children near the coastal village of Muchalls, Scotland (but not in the village itself), from 1971 onwards. These events are claimed to have continued night after night for many years. The phenomena are reputed to have continued at least until 1991 when some aspects of the apparitions were also filmed in the area.\n16 October 1973: It is alleged that Gabriella Versacci was taken on board an alien space ship near a small village in Somerset, England. She was physically inspected when strapped down to an examination table.\n23 January 1974: A UFO allegedly crashed at Berwyn Mountain, Wales.  The event coincided with an earthquake.\nJune 1976: An official British Airways film taken during one of the Concorde\'s flights over southern England depicts a white light which turns around the fuselage of the aircraft.

(40, 'Barney and Betty Hill', 'Barney and Betty Hill were an American couple who claimed they were abducted by extraterrestrials in a rural portion of the state of New Hampshire from September 19 to September 20, 1961. It was the first widely publicized report of an alien abduction in the United States.\nThe incident came to be called the \"Hill Abduction\" and the \"Zeta Reticuli Incident\" because the couple stated they had been kidnapped by aliens who claimed to be from the Zeta Reticuli system. Their story was adapted into the best-selling 1966 book The Interrupted Journey and the 1975 television movie The UFO Incident.  In September 2016, plans were announced to make a film based on the events, with an unknown release date.Most of Betty Hill\'s notes, tapes, and other items have been placed in the permanent collection at the University of New Hampshire, her alma mater. In July 2011, the state Division of Historical Resources marked the site of the alleged craft\'s first approach with a historical marker.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe Hills lived in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. Barney (1922–1969) was employed by the United States Postal Service, while Betty (née Eunice Barrett) (1919–2004) was a social worker. Active in the local Unitarian congregation, the Hills were also members of the NAACP and community leaders, and Barney sat on a local board of the United States Commission on Civil Rights. They were an interracial couple at a time when it was particularly uncommon in the United States; Barney was African American and Betty was white.\n\n\n== UFO encounter ==\nAccording to a variety of reports given by the Hills, the alleged UFO sighting happened on September 19, 1961, around 10:30 p.m. The Hills were driving back to Portsmouth from a vacation in Niagara Falls and Montreal. Just south of Lancaster, New Hampshire, Betty claimed to have observed a bright point of light in the sky that moved from below the moon and the planet Jupiter, upward to the west of the moon. While Barney navigated U.S. Route 3, Betty reasoned that she was observing a falling star, only it moved upward. Since it moved erratically and grew bigger and brighter, Betty urged Barney to stop the car for a closer look, as well as to walk their dog, Delsey. Barney stopped at a scenic picnic area just south of Twin Mountain.Betty, looking through binoculars, observed an \"odd-shaped\" craft flashing multi-colored lights travel across the face of the Moon. Because her sister had several years earlier said she had seen a flying saucer, Betty thought it might be what she was observing. Through binoculars, Barney observed what he reasoned was a commercial airliner traveling toward Vermont on its way to Montreal. However, he soon changed his mind, because without looking as if it had turned, the craft rapidly descended in his direction. This observation caused Barney to realize, \"this object that was a plane was not a plane.\" He quickly returned to the car and drove toward Franconia Notch, a narrow, mountainous stretch of the road.\nThe Hills claimed that they continued driving on the isolated road, moving very slowly through Franconia Notch in order to observe the object as it came even closer. At one point, the object passed above a restaurant and signal tower on top of Cannon Mountain and came out near the Old Man of the Mountain. Betty testified that it was at least one and a half times the length of the granite cliff profile, which was 40 feet (12 m) long, and that it seemed to be rotating. The couple watched as the silent, illuminated craft moved erratically and bounced back and forth in the night sky.Approximately one mile south of Indian Head, they said, the object rapidly descended toward their vehicle, causing Barney to stop in the middle of the highway. The huge, silent craft hovered approximately 80–100 feet (24–30 m) above the Hills\' 1957 Chevrolet Bel Air and filled the entire field of view in the windshield. It reminded Barney of a huge pancake. Carrying his pistol in his pocket, he stepped away from the vehicle and moved closer to the object. Using the binoculars, Barney claimed to have seen about 8 to 11 humanoid figures, who were peering out of the craft\'s windows, seeming to look at him. In unison, all but one figure moved to what appeared to be a panel on the rear wall of the hallway that encircled the front portion of the craft. The one remaining figure continued to look at Barney and communicated a message telling him to \"stay where you are and keep looking.\" Barney had a recollection of observing the humanoid forms wearing glossy black uniforms and black caps. Red lights on what appeared to be bat-wing fins began to telescope out of the sides of the craft, and a long structure descended from the bottom of the craft. The silent craft approached to what Barney estimated was within 50–80 feet (15–24 m) overhead and 300 feet (91 m) away from him. On October 21, 1961, Barney reported to National Investigations Committee On Aerial Phenomena (NICAP) investigator Walter Webb that the \"beings were somehow not human\".Barney \"tore\" the binoculars away from his eyes and ran back to his car. In a near hysterical state, he told Betty, \"They\'re going to capture us!\" He saw the object again shift its location to directly above the vehicle. He drove away at high speed, telling Betty to look for the object. She rolled down the window and looked up. Almost immediately, the Hills heard a rhythmic series of beeping or buzzing sounds, which they said seemed to bounce off the trunk of their vehicle. The car vibrated and a tingling sensation passed through the Hills\' bodies. The Hills said that then they experienced the onset of an altered state of consciousness that left their minds dulled. A second series of beeping or buzzing sounds returned the couple to full consciousness. They found that they had traveled nearly 35 miles (56 km) south, but had only vague, spotty memories of this section of road. They recalled making a sudden, unplanned turn, encountering a roadblock, and observing a fiery orb in the road.\n\n\n== Immediate aftermath ==\nArriving home at about dawn, the Hills assert that they had some odd sensations and impulses they could not readily explain: Betty insisted their luggage be kept near the back door rather than in the main part of the house. Their watches would never run again. Barney said that the leather strap for the binoculars was torn, though he could not recall it tearing. The toes of his best dress shoes were scraped. Barney says he was compelled to examine his genitals in the bathroom, though he found nothing unusual. They took long showers to remove possible contamination and each drew a picture of what they had observed.Perplexed, the Hills say they tried to reconstruct the chronology of events as they witnessed the UFO and drove home. But immediately after they heard the buzzing sounds, their memories became incomplete and fragmented. After sleeping for a few hours, Betty awoke and placed the shoes and clothing she had worn during the drive into her closet, observing that the dress was torn at the hem, zipper and lining. Later, when she retrieved the items from her closet, she noted a pinkish powder on her dress. She hung the dress on her clothesline and the pink powder blew away. But the dress was irreparably damaged. She threw it away, but then changed her mind, retrieving the dress and hanging it in her closet. Over the years, five laboratories have conducted chemical and forensic analyses on the dress.There were shiny, concentric circles on their car\'s trunk that had not been there the previous day. Betty and Barney experimented with a compass, noting that when they moved it close to the spots, the needle would whirl rapidly. But when they moved it a few inches away from the shiny spots, it would drop down.\n\n\n=== Initial report to the U.S. Air Force and NICAP ===\nOn September 21, Betty telephoned Pease Air Force Base to report their UFO encounter, though for fear of being labeled eccentric, she withheld some of the details. On September 22, Major Paul W. Henderson telephoned the Hills for a more detailed interview. Henderson\'s report, dated September 26, determined that the Hills had probably misidentified the planet Jupiter. (This was later changed to \"optical condition\", \"inversion\" and \"insufficient data\".) (Report 100-1-61, Air Intelligence Information Record) His report was forwarded to Project Blue Book, the U.S. Air Force\'s UFO research project.\nWithin days of the encounter, Betty borrowed a UFO book from a local library. It had been written by retired Marine Corps Major Donald E. Keyhoe, who was also the head of NICAP, a civilian UFO research group. On September 26, Betty wrote to Keyhoe. She related the full story, including the details about the humanoid figures that Barney had observed through binoculars. Betty wrote that she and Barney were considering hypnosis to help recall what had happened. Her letter was eventually passed on to Walter N. Webb, a Boston astronomer and NICAP member.\nWebb met with the Hills on October 21, 1961. In a six-hour interview, the Hills related all they could remember of the UFO encounter. Barney asserted that he had developed a sort of \"mental block\" and that he suspected there were some portions of the event that he did not wish to remember. He described in detail all that he could remember about the craft and the appearance of the \"somehow not human\" figures aboard the craft. Webb stated that \"they were telling the truth and the incident probably occurred exactly as reported except for some minor uncertainties and technicalities that must be tolerated in any such observations where human judgment is involved (e.g., exact time and length of visibility, apparent sizes of object and occupants, distance and height of object, etc.).\"\n\n\n== Betty\'s dreams ==\nTen days after the alleged UFO encounter, Betty began having a series of vivid dreams. They continued for five successive nights. Never in her memory had she recalled dreams in such detail and intensity. But they stopped abruptly after five nights and never returned again. They occupied her thoughts during the day. When she finally did mention them to Barney, he was sympathetic, but not too concerned, and the matter was dropped. Betty did not mention them to Barney again.In November 1961, Betty began writing down the details of her dreams. In one dream, she and Barney encountered a roadblock and men who surrounded their car. She lost consciousness, but struggled to regain it. She then realized that she was being forced by two small men to walk in a forest in the nighttime, and of seeing Barney walking behind her, though when she called to him, he seemed to be in a trance or sleepwalking. The men stood about five feet to five feet four inches tall, and wore matching blue uniforms, with caps similar to those worn by military cadets. They appeared nearly human, with black hair, dark eyes, prominent noses and bluish lips. Their skin was a greyish colour.In the dreams, Betty, Barney, and the men walked up a ramp into a disc-shaped craft of metallic appearance. Once inside, Barney and Betty were separated. She protested, and was told by a man she called \"the leader\" that if she and Barney were examined together, it would take much longer to conduct the exams. She and Barney were then taken to separate rooms.\nBetty then dreamt that a new man, similar to the others, entered to conduct her exam with the leader. Betty called this new man \"the examiner\" and said he had a pleasant, calm manner. Though the leader and the examiner spoke to her in English, the examiner\'s command of the language seemed imperfect and she had difficulty understanding him.\nThe examiner told Betty that he would conduct a few tests to note the differences between humans and the craft\'s occupants. He seated her on a chair, and a bright light was shone on her. The man cut off a lock of Betty\'s hair. He examined her eyes, ears, mouth, teeth, throat and hands. He saved trimmings from her fingernails. After examining her legs and feet, the man then used a dull knife, similar to a letter opener, to scrape some of her skin onto what resembled cellophane. He then tested her nervous system and he thrust the needle into her navel, which caused Betty agonizing pain, whereupon the leader waved his hand in front of her eyes and the pain vanished.\nThe examiner left the room and Betty engaged in conversation with the \"leader\". She picked up a book with rows of strange symbols that the \"leader\" said she could take home with her. She also asked from where he came, and he pulled down an instructional map dotted with stars.\nIn Betty\'s dream account, the men began escorting the Hills from the ship when a disagreement broke out. The leader then informed Betty that she couldn\'t keep the book, stating that they had decided that the other men did not want her to even remember the encounter. Betty insisted that no matter what they did to her memory, she would one day recall the events.\nShe and Barney were taken to their car, where the leader suggested that they wait to watch the craft\'s departure. They did so, then resumed their drive.\n\n\n== Medical help and more interviews ==\n\n\n=== Missing time ===\nOn November 25, 1961, the Hills were again interviewed at length by NICAP members, this time C. D. Jackson and Robert E. Hohmann.\nAlthough the Hills had noted that they had arrived home later than anticipated, the drive should have taken about four hours (178 miles). They claimed not to have realized that they arrived home seven hours after their departure from Colebrook. When Hohman and Jackson noted this discrepancy to the Hills, the couple had no explanation (a phenomenon ufologists call \"missing time\"). The Hills claimed to recall almost nothing of the 35 miles of US Route 3 between Lincoln/Indian Head and Ashland. Both claimed to recall an image of a fiery orb sitting on the ground. Betty and Barney reasoned that it must have been the moon, but Hohmann and Jackson informed them that the moon had set earlier in the evening.The subject of hypnosis came up, and it was decided that it should be carried out in order to elicit previously irretrievable memories. Barney was apprehensive about hypnosis, but thought it might help Betty put to rest what Barney described as \"the \'nonsense\' about her dreams.\"By February 1962, the Hills were making frequent weekend drives to the White Mountains, hoping that revisiting the site might spark more memories. They were unsuccessful in trying to locate the site where they observed a fiery orb sitting in the road. However, they were able to eliminate several possible routes. (They found what they claimed was the \"capture\" site on Labor Day weekend in 1965.)\n\n\n=== Private disclosure ===\nOn November 23, 1962, the Hills attended a meeting at the parsonage of their church where the invited guest speaker was Captain Ben H. Swett of the United States Air Force, who had recently published a book of his poetry. After he read selections of his poetry, the pastor asked him to discuss his personal interest in hypnosis. After the meeting broke up, the Hills approached Captain Swett privately and told him what they could remember of their strange encounter. He was particularly interested in the \"missing time\" of the Hills\' account. The Hills asked Swett if he would hypnotize them to recover their memories, but Swett said he was not qualified to do that and cautioned them against going to an amateur hypnotist, such as himself.\n\n\n=== First public disclosure ===\nOn March 3, 1963, the Hills first publicly discussed the UFO encounter with a group at their church.\nOn September 7, 1963, Captain Swett gave a formal lecture on hypnosis to a meeting at the Unitarian Church. After the lecture, the Hills told him that Barney was going to a psychiatrist, a Mr. Stephens, whom he liked and trusted. Captain Swett suggested that Barney ask Stephens about the use of hypnosis in his case.\nWhen Barney next met with Stephens, he asked about hypnosis. Stephens referred the Hills to Benjamin Simon of Boston.\nOn November 3, 1963, the Hills spoke before an amateur UFO study group, the Two State UFO Study Group, in Quincy Center, Massachusetts.\nThe Hills first met Simon on December 14, 1963. Early in their discussions, Simon determined that the UFO encounter was causing Barney far more worry and anxiety than he was willing to admit. Though Simon dismissed the popular extraterrestrial hypothesis as impossible, it seemed obvious to him that the Hills genuinely thought they had witnessed a UFO with human-like occupants. Simon hoped to uncover more about the experience through hypnosis.\n\n\n== Simon\'s hypnosis sessions ==\nSimon began hypnotizing the Hills on January 4, 1964. He hypnotized Betty and Barney several times each, and the sessions lasted until June 6, 1964. Simon conducted the sessions on Barney and Betty separately, so they could not overhear one another\'s recollections. At the end of each session he reinstated amnesia.\n\n\n=== Barney\'s sessions ===\nSimon hypnotized Barney first. His recall of witnessing non-human figures was quite emotional, punctuated with expressions of fear, emotional outbursts and incredulity. Barney said that, due to his fear, he kept his eyes closed for much of the abduction and physical examination. Based on these early responses, Simon told Barney that he would not remember the hypnosis sessions until he was certain he could remember them without being further traumatized.\nUnder hypnosis (as was consistent with his conscious recall), Barney reported that the binocular strap had broken when he ran from the UFO back to his car. He recalled driving the car away from the UFO, but that afterwards he felt irresistibly compelled to pull off the road and drive into the woods. He eventually sighted six men standing in the dirt road. The car stalled and three of the men approached the car. They told Barney to not fear them. He was still anxious, however, and he reported that the leader told Barney to close his eyes. While hypnotized, Barney said, \"I felt like the eyes had pushed into my eyes.\"Barney described the beings as generally similar to Betty\'s hypnotic (not dream) recollection. The beings often stared into his eyes, said Barney, with a terrifying, mesmerizing effect. Under hypnosis, Barney said things like, \"Oh, those eyes. They\'re there in my brain\" (from his first hypnosis session) and \"I was told to close my eyes because I saw two eyes coming close to mine, and I felt like the eyes had pushed into my eyes\" (from his second hypnosis session) and \"All I see are these eyes... I\'m not even afraid that they\'re not connected to a body. They\'re just there. They\'re just up close to me, pressing against my eyes.\"Barney related that he and Betty were taken onto the disc-shaped craft, where they were separated. He was escorted to a room by three of the men and told to lie on a small rectangular exam table. Unlike Betty, Barney\'s narrative of the exam was less detailed, as he continued to keep his eyes closed for most of the exam. A cup-like device was placed over his genitals. He did not experience an orgasm, though Barney thought that a sperm sample had been taken. The men scraped his skin and peered in his ears and mouth. A thin tube or cylinder was inserted into his anus and quickly removed. Someone felt his spine and seemed to be counting his vertebrae.\nBetty reported a conversation with the \"leader\" that she understood in English. Barney said that he heard them speaking in a mumbling language he did not understand, yet he also understood them in English. Betty also mentioned this detail. The few times they communicated with him, Barney said it seemed to be \"thought transference\"; at that time, he was unfamiliar with the word \"telepathy\". Both Betty and Barney stated that they hadn\'t observed the beings\' mouths moving when they communicated in English with them.\nHe recalled being escorted from the ship and taken to his car. In a daze, he watched the ship leave. Barney remembered a light appearing on the road, and he said, \"Oh no, not again.\" He recalled Betty\'s speculation that the light might have been the moon, though the moon had in fact set several hours earlier. He also stated that he attempted to produce the code-like buzzing sounds which seemed to strike the car\'s trunk a second time by driving from side to side and stopping and starting the vehicle. His attempt was unsuccessful.\n\n\n=== Betty\'s sessions ===\nUnder hypnosis, Betty\'s account was similar to the events of her five dreams about the UFO abduction, but there were also notable differences, mainly pertaining to her capture and release. The technology on the craft was different. The short men had a significantly different physical appearance from that of her dreams. The sequential order of the abduction event was also different from Betty\'s dream account.  Barney\'s and Betty\'s memories in hypnotic regression were consistent with one another but contradicted some of the information in Betty\'s dreams.Betty exhibited considerable emotional distress during her capture and examination. Simon ended one session early because tears were flowing down her cheeks and she appeared distressed.\nSimon gave Betty the post-hypnotic suggestion that she could sketch a copy of the \"star map\" that she later described as a three-dimensional projection similar to a hologram. Eventually, she did what Simon suggested.  Although she said the map had many stars, she drew only those that stood out in her memory. Her map consisted of twelve prominent stars connected by lines and three lesser ones that formed a distinctive triangle (see below). She said she was told the stars connected by solid lines formed \"trade routes\", whereas dashed lines were to less-traveled stars.\n\n\n=== Simon\'s conclusions ===\nAfter the hypnosis sessions, Simon speculated that Barney\'s recollection of the UFO encounter was possibly a fantasy inspired by Betty\'s dreams. Simon thought it was the most reasonable and consistent explanation. Barney rejected this idea, noting that while their memories were consistent in some regards, there were also portions of both their narratives that were unique to each. Barney was now ready to accept that they had been abducted by the occupants of a UFO, though he never embraced it as fully as Betty did.\nThough the Hills and Simon disagreed about the nature of the case, they all concurred that the hypnosis sessions were effective: the Hills were no longer tormented by anxiety about their experience.\nAfterwards, Simon wrote an article about the Hills for the journal Psychiatric Opinion, explaining his conclusions that the case was a singular psychological aberration.\n\n\n== Publicity after the hypnosis sessions ==\nThe Hills went back to their regular lives. They were willing to discuss the alleged UFO encounter with friends, family and the occasional UFO researcher, but the Hills apparently made no effort to seek publicity.\nOn October 25, 1965, a front page story in the Boston Traveller asked \"UFO Chiller: Did THEY Seize Couple?\" Reporter John H. Luttrell of the Traveler had allegedly been given an audio tape recording of the lecture the Hills had made in Quincy Center in late 1963. Luttrell learned that the Hills had undergone hypnosis with Simon; he also obtained notes from confidential interviews the Hills had given to UFO investigators. On October 26, United Press International (UPI) picked up Luttrell\'s story, and the Hills earned international attention.\nIn 1966, writer John G. Fuller secured the cooperation of the Hills and Simon and wrote the book The Interrupted Journey (see below) about the case. The book included a copy of Betty\'s sketch of the \"star map\". The book was a quick success, and went through several printings.Later in life, Betty claimed to have seen UFOs a number of times after the initial abduction, and she \"became a celebrity in the UFO community.\"Barney died of a cerebral hemorrhage on February 25, 1969, at age 46; Betty Hill died of cancer on October 17, 2004, at age 85, never having remarried.\n\n\n== Analyzing the star map ==\n\nIn 1968, Marjorie Fish of Oak Harbor, Ohio, read Fuller\'s Interrupted Journey. She was an elementary school teacher and amateur astronomer. Intrigued by the \"star map\", Fish wondered if it might be \"deciphered\" to determine which star system the UFO came from. Assuming that one of the fifteen stars on the map must represent the Earth\'s Sun, Fish constructed a three-dimensional model of nearby Sun-like stars using thread and beads, basing stellar distances on those published in the 1969 Gliese Star Catalogue. Studying thousands of vantage points over several years, the only one that seemed to match the Hill map was from the viewpoint of the double star system of Zeta Reticuli.\nFish sent her analysis to Webb. Agreeing with her conclusions, Webb sent the map to Terence Dickinson, editor of the popular magazine Astronomy. Dickinson did not endorse Fish and Webb\'s conclusions, but for the first time in the journal\'s history, Astronomy invited comments and debate on a UFO report, starting with an opening article in the December 1974 issue. For about a year afterward, the opinions page of Astronomy carried arguments for and against Fish\'s star map. Notable was an argument made by Carl Sagan and Steven Soter, arguing that the seeming \"star map\" was little more than a random alignment of chance points. In an episode of Cosmos in 1980, Sagan demonstrated that without the lines drawn in the maps, the Hill map bore no resemblance to the real-life map. In contrast, those more favorable to the map, such as David Saunders, a statistician who had been on the Condon UFO study, argued that unusual alignment of key Sun-like stars in a plane centered around Zeta Reticuli (first described by Fish) was statistically improbable to have happened by chance from a random group of stars in our immediate neighborhood.\n\n\n== Interrupted Journey ==\nThe 1966 publication of Interrupted Journey, by John G. Fuller, details much of the Hills\' claims. Excerpts of the book were published in Look magazine, and Interrupted Journey went on to sell many copies and greatly publicize the Hills\' account. Betty\'s niece Kathleen Marden explored Fuller\'s themes along with scientist Stanton T. Friedman in her book Captured! The Betty and Barney Hill UFO Experience. Marden knew Betty well and had spoken with her at great length about the encounter. She also examined all of the historical records and scientific reports pertaining to the case and transcribed the Hills\' hypnosis sessions with Benjamin Simon for her detailed comparative analysis.\n\n\n== Refutations ==\nPsychiatrists later suggested that the supposed abduction was a hallucination brought on by the stress of being an interracial couple in early 1960s United States. Betty discounted this suggestion, noting her relationship with Barney was happy, and their interracial marriage caused no notable problems with their friends or family. As noted in The Interrupted Journey, Simon thought that the Hills\' marital status had nothing to do with the UFO encounter.\nSkeptic blogger Brian Dunning noted that the hypnosis sessions occurred over two years after the reported abductions, which afforded the couple plenty of time to discuss their encounter.  Dunning concluded that the Hills\' \"inventive tale from the mind of a lifelong UFO fanatic ... is unsupported by any useful evidence, and is perfectly consistent with the purely natural explanation.\" He added that a timeline analysis of the two Air Force radar sightings from that night in the Project Blue Book record shows that neither correlated with the Hills\' story. The Air Force concluded that both targets were probably weather balloons.\n\nIn his 1990 article \"Entirely Unpredisposed\", Martin Kottmeyer suggested that Barney\'s memories revealed under hypnosis might have been influenced by an episode of the science fiction television show The Outer Limits, titled \"The Bellero Shield\", which was broadcast about two weeks before Barney\'s first hypnotic session. The episode featured an extraterrestrial with large eyes who says, \"In all the universes, in all the unities beyond the universes, all who have eyes have eyes that speak.\" The report from the regression featured a scenario that was in some respects similar to the television show. In part, Kottmeyer wrote:\nWraparound eyes are an extreme rarity in science fiction films. I know of only one instance. They appeared on the alien of an episode of an old TV series The Outer Limits entitled \"The Bellero Shield\". A person familiar with Barney\'s sketch in \"The Interrupted Journey\" and the sketch done in collaboration with the artist David Baker will find a \"frisson\" of \"déjà vu\" creeping up his spine when seeing this episode. The resemblance is much abetted by an absence of ears, hair, and nose on both aliens. Could it be by chance? Consider this: Barney first described and drew the wraparound eyes during the hypnosis session dated 22 February 1964. \"The Bellero Shield\" was first broadcast on 10 February 1964. Only twelve days separate the two instances. If the identification is admitted, the commonness of wraparound eyes in the abduction literature falls to cultural forces.\nWhen a different researcher asked Betty about The Outer Limits, she insisted she had \"never heard of it\". Kottmeyer also pointed out that some motifs in the Hills\' account were present in the 1953 film, Invaders from Mars. A careful analysis of Barney\'s description of the non-human entities that he observed reveals significant similarities between the \"Bifrost Man\" and Barney\'s descriptive details. One must also take into account Barney\'s conscious, continuous recall of the entities he observed on the hovering craft. They were dressed in black, shiny uniforms and were \"somehow not human\".\nJim Macdonald, a resident of the area in which the Hills claimed to have been abducted, has produced a detailed analysis of their journey which concludes that the episode was provoked by their misperceiving an aircraft warning beacon on Cannon Mountain as a UFO. Macdonald notes that from the road the Hills took, the beacon appears and disappears at exactly the same time the Hills describe the UFO as appearing and disappearing. The remainder of the experience is ascribed to stress, sleep deprivation, and false memories \"recovered\" under hypnosis. UFO expert Robert Sheaffer writes after reading Macdonald\'s recreation that the Hills are the \"poster children\" for not driving when sleep deprived. Macdonald\'s article focuses primarily on the Hills\' observations of the light in the sky and the timing of the journey, discounting the Hills\' accounts of close encounters south of Cannon Mountain as recovered memories.\nSkeptical Inquirer columnist Robert Shaeffer wrote the following:\n\nI was present at the National UFO Conference in New York City in 1980, at which Betty presented some of the UFO photos she had taken. She showed what must have been well over two hundred slides, mostly of blips, blurs, and blobs against a dark background. These were supposed to be UFOs coming in close, chasing her car, landing, etc... After her talk had exceeded about twice its allotted time, Betty was literally jeered off the stage by what had been at first a very sympathetic audience. This incident, witnessed by many of UFOlogy\'s leaders and top activists, removed any lingering doubts about Betty\'s credibility—she had none. In 1995, Betty Hill wrote a self-published book, A Common Sense Approach to UFOs. It is filled with obviously delusional stories, such as seeing entire squadrons of UFOs in flight and a truck levitating above the freeway.\nSheaffer later wrote that as late as 1977, Betty Hill would go on UFO vigils at least three times a week. During one evening she was joined by UFO enthusiast John Oswald. When asked about Betty\'s continuing UFO observations, Oswald stated, \"She is not really seeing UFOs, but she is calling them that.\" On the night they went out together, \"Mrs. Hill was unable to distinguish between a landed UFO and a streetlight\". In a later interview, Sheaffer recounts that Betty Hill writes \"UFOs are a new science ... and our science cannot explain them\".Robert Sheaffer released 48 pages of archived documents relating to Betty and Barney Hill, Benjamin Simon and Philip J. Klass on the Internet on December 23, 2015.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nBarney Hill was on an episode of To Tell the Truth, episode airdate December 12, 1966.\nThe couple was portrayed by James Earl Jones and Estelle Parsons in the 1975 television film adapted by S. Lee Pogostin, The UFO Incident, and by Basil Wallace and Lee Garlington in the 1996 television series Dark Skies.\nThe encounter was portrayed in a segment on the 12th episode of Carl Sagan\'s miniseries Cosmos, \"Encyclopedia Galactica\".\nDetails of the Hills\' case were used in The X-Files episode \"Jose Chung\'s From Outer Space\".\nThe graphic novel Saucer Country (2012) by Paul Cornell includes the Hills\' experience.\nAn episode of the Travel Channel series Mysteries at the Museum covered the subject of the abduction.\nIn the second season of American Horror Story, called Asylum, Evan Peters and Britne Oldford portray interracial couple Kit and Alma Walker who were abducted by aliens and most likely based on the Hills.\nIn the Gravity Falls episode \"Dipper and Mabel vs. The Future\" there is a cryptogram on a UFO that reads \"Betty and Barney were here\".\nIn September 2017, on the People of Earth episode titled \"Alien Experiencer Expo\", a poster of the Hills is presented at the exposition, with the title \"Betty & Barney Hill, First Couple of the Cosmos\".\nIn May 2018, the Culture and Myth Podcast series \"Lore\" covered the event in \"Episode 87: Road Trip\".\nIn 2018, the story forms the basis of the \"Dinner Party\" virtual reality exhibit at the travelling art show Wonderspaces.\nThe podcast \"And That\'s Why We Drink\" covered the Hills\' story in their January 7, 2018 episode, \"Bananas in Pajamas and Your Friendly Local Kioskman.\"\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of reported UFO sightings\nSerpo\nZeta Reticuli in fiction\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Book sources ==\nClark, Jerome.

(42, 'Douglas DC-4', 'The Douglas DC-4 is a four-engine (piston) propeller-driven airliner developed by the Douglas Aircraft Company. Military versions of the plane, the C-54 and R5D, served during World War II, in the Berlin Airlift and into the 1960s. From 1945, many civil airlines operated the DC-4 worldwide.\n\n\n== Design and development ==\nFollowing proving flights by United Airlines of the DC-4E it became obvious that the 52-seat airliner was too large to operate economically and the partner airlines recommended a long list of changes required to the design. Douglas took the new requirement and produced a new design, the DC-4A, with a simpler unpressurised fuselage, R-2000 Twin Wasp engines and a single fin and rudder.\nWith the entry of the United States into World War II, in June 1941 the War Department took over the provision orders for the airlines and allocated them to the United States Army Air Forces with the designation C-54 Skymaster. The first, a C-54, flew from Clover Field in Santa Monica, California on 14 February 1942.\n\nTo meet military requirements the first production aircraft had four additional auxiliary fuel tanks in the main cabin which reduced the passenger seats to 26. The following batch of aircraft were designated C-54A and were built with a stronger floor, cargo door with a hoist and winch. The first C-54A was delivered in February 1943. With the introduction of the C-54B in March 1944, the outer wings were changed to hold integral fuel tanks allowing two of the cabin tanks to be removed; this allowed 49 seats (or 16 stretchers) to be fitted. The C-54C was a hybrid for Presidential use, it had a C-54A fuselage with four cabin fuel tanks and the C-54B wings with built-in tanks to achieve maximum range.\n\nThe most common variant was the C-54D, which entered service in August 1944, a C-54B with more powerful R-2000-11 engines. With the C-54E the last two cabin fuel tanks were moved to the wings which allowed more freight or 44 passenger seats.\nA total of 1,163 C-54/R5Ds were built for the United States military between 1942 and January 1946; another 79 DC-4s were built postwar. A variant, equipped to fly over 40% faster, was built in Canada postwar as the Canadair North Star.\n\n\n== Operational history ==\nThe DC-4/C-54 proved a popular and reliable type, 1245 being built between May 1942 and August 1947, including 79 postwar DC-4s. Several remain in service as of 2014. One current operator is Buffalo Airways of Yellowknife, Northwest Territories.Douglas continued to develop the type during the war in preparation for a return to airline use when peace returned. The type\'s sales prospects were affected when 500 wartime ex military C-54s and R5Ds came onto the civil market, many being converted to DC-4 standard by Douglas. DC-4s were a favorite of charter airlines such as Great Lakes Airlines, North American Airlines, Universal Airlines and Transocean Airlines. In the 1950s Transocean (Oakland, California) was the largest civil C-54/DC-4 operator.\n\nDouglas produced 79 new-build DC-4s between January 1946 and August 9, 1947, the last example being delivered to South African Airways (8). Pressurization was an option, but all civil DC-4s (and C-54s) were built un-pressurized.\nA total of 330 DC-4s and C-54s were used in the Berlin Airlift, which made them the most used types.\nPurchasers of new-build DC-4s included Pan American Airways, National Airlines, Northwest Airlines and Western Airlines in the USA, and KLM Royal Dutch Air Lines, Scandinavian Airlines System, Iberia Airlines of Spain, Swissair, Air France, Sabena Belgian World Airlines, Cubana de Aviación, Avianca, Aerolíneas Argentinas, Aeropostal of Venezuela (1946) and South African Airways overseas. Several airlines used new-build DC-4s to start scheduled transatlantic flights between Latin America and Europe. Among the earliest were Aerolíneas Argentinas (1946), Aeropostal of Venezuela (1946), Iberia Airlines of Spain (1946), and Cubana de Aviación (1948).\nBasic prices for a new DC-4 in 1946-7 was around £140,000-£160,000. In 1960 used DC-4s were available for around £80,000.\n\n\n== Variants ==\n\nDC-4\nMain production airliner, postwar.\nCanadair North Star\nCanadian production of a Rolls-Royce Merlin –  powered variant, plus a single Pratt & Whitney R-2800 –  powered aircraft.Aviation Traders Carvair\nBritish cargo and car ferry adaptation.\n\n\n== Operators ==\n\n\n== Accidents and incidents ==\n\n\n== Surviving aircraft ==\n\nVery few DC-4s remain in service today. The last two passenger DC-4s operating worldwide are based in Johannesburg, South Africa. They fly with old South African Airways (SAA) colors. They are ZS-AUB \"Outeniqua\" and ZS-BMH \"Lebombo\" and are owned by the South African Airways Museum Society and operated by Skyclass Aviation, a company specializing in classic and VIP charters to exotic destinations in Africa.\nA 1944-built DC-4 is currently being restored in New South Wales, Australia. Buffalo Airways in Canada\'s Northwest Territories owns roughly a dozen DC-4s (former C-54s of various versions); four for hauling cargo and three for aerial firefighting. A 1945-built DC-4 (C-54E) c/n 27370 is currently operating as a flying museum of the Berlin Airlift. Called the \"Spirit of Freedom\", it has been touring the world for nearly 20 years. Alaska Air Fuel also operates two DC4s out of Palmer, Alaska.

(43, 'Ellsworth UFO sighting', 'The Ellsworth UFO case occurred in 1953.\n\n\n== Important Radar-Visual UFO ==\nOn August 5 and August 6, 1953 the US Military investigated a UFO incident in Rapid City, South Dakota. What has become known as the Ellsworth Case is one of the most significant radar-visual cases in the annals of UFO sightings.\nThe event was witnessed by almost forty-five agitated citizens along with military Air Defense System personnel. The object was first sighted by Miss Killian at 8:00 P.M. on August 5. The description was of a red glowing light making long sweeping movements.\n\n\n== Erratic Motion Observed ==\nThe information was transmitted to the Bismarck, North Dakota, Air Defense Filter Center. Sometime later Sergeant Harry spotted the objects from the roof. He observed, paying close attention to the irregular movement, as it danced between telephone lines. Others on duty saw the moving light which would be visible in the night sky for approximately three hours. Sergeant Harry described his observance in the following manner: It would remain stationary--then hop up several degrees very quickly--almost simultaneously. Another witness commented, It would stop...move to the left and then swerve down in a sort of slanting motion, repeating these maneuvers several times.\n\n\n== Immense Luminosity Seen By F-84 Pilots ==\nAt midnight three additional objects appeared in the sky above Dakota. The employees of the Filter Center had a feeling like someone was watching them. Before they were seen in Bismarck, two F-84s had been vectored into the area over Blackhawk, South Dakota. The objects and the jets were monitored on radar. One pilot established visual contact for twenty to thirty seconds. His description could be heard over the intercom. It\'s brighter than the brightest star I\'ve ever seen. When the pilot gave chase the light inexplicably disappeared.\nLieutenant Needham, the second pilot spotted one of the objects at 15,000 feet. It was below him and to his right. The object moved spasmodically up and down. The colors changed from white to green. In pursuit Needham climbed to 26,000 feet. He changed course to 360 degrees. After maintaining steady on 360 degrees for a brief time, his radar lock-on-light on the A-4 gun-sight came on and remained on. The object was ahead of him. It increased speed and moved rapidly ahead and up.\nThe chase was being carried on the radarscope at the control room. Radar indicated that the UFO was staying five to ten miles ahead of the Lieutenant and his F-84. Finally Lieutenant Needham gave up his pursuit and flew back to the Military base. The object continued on and was detected by the Filter Center in Bismarck.\n\n\n== Varied Colors Emulate A Wave ==\nAt 1:09 A.M. an Air Force Globemaster Globemaster II flew over Bismarck. As the plane neared, the object closest to the plane appeared to emanate a signal by blinking red and green. This signaling was picked up by the other three objects. An observer reflected about this, It was as if a \'wave\' passed from one to the other.\nA signaling effect influenced a then-classified Air Force report filed by Dr. Hynek. He concluded, The entire incident, in my opinion, has too much of an Alice in Wonderland flavor for comfort. In the late 1970s Hynek confirmed his conclusion, That\'s exactly how I felt at the time.\nThe Air Force offered a number of possibilities as to the cause of the sightings. In the final synopsis the objects would continue on the records as \"unknowns\".\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of major UFO sightings\nBismarck, North Dakota\nEllsworth Air Force Base\nF-84\nC-24\nUFO\n\n\n== References ==\n\nEpisode of \"Mysteries at the Monument\" on the Travel Channel first aired in 2016, repeated about March 22, 2018 gives an account of this event..\n\n\n== External links ==\nEllsworth UFO Case - UFO Casebook\nEllsworth UFO Case - NICAP\nEllsworth UFO Case - NICAP', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d7/Blue_pog.svg');

(44, 'Narrative of the abduction phenomenon', 'The narrative of the abduction phenomenon is an alleged core of similarity in contents and chronology underlying various claims of forced temporary abduction of humans by apparently otherworldly beings. Proponents of the abduction phenomenon contend that this similarity is evidence of the veracity of the phenomenon as an objective reality, although this belief is disregarded by most scientists, who regard alien abduction as a purely psychological and cultural phenomenon.\nSkeptics of the abduction phenomenon contend that similarities between reports arise from commonalities rooted in human psychology and neurology or cast doubt on the presence of similarities between reports at all. They note the evolving contents of abduction claims and the apparent effect of culture on the details of the narratives as evidence that the phenomenon is a purely subjective experience. Skeptics also point out the likelihood of large numbers of hoaxes being present in the abduction literature.\nCurrently the skeptical perspective is the most prevalent among scientists and academics. Many scientists believe that pro-abduction researchers are practising pseudoscience, alleging that they lack the skepticism and methodological rigor of true scientists.\nBelievers assert that it is unlikely for hundreds of people to independently generate such similar narratives while apparently having no knowledge of each other\'s claims. Some abduction investigators attempt to confirm the reality of events reported in abduction claims through observation or experimentation, although such efforts are generally dismissed as pseudoscientific by mainstream academics.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nAlthough different cases vary in detail (sometimes significantly), some UFO researchers, such as folklorist Thomas E. Bullard argue that there is a broad, fairly consistent sequence and description of events which make up the typical \"close encounter of the fourth kind\" (a popular but unofficial designation building on Dr. J. Allen Hynek\'s classifying terminology). Though the features outlined below are often reported, there is some disagreement as to exactly how often they actually occur. Some researchers (especially Budd Hopkins and David M. Jacobs) have been accused of excluding, minimising or suppressing testimony or data which do not fit a certain paradigm for the phenomenon.Bullard argues most abduction accounts feature the following events. They generally follow the sequence noted below, though not all abductions feature all the events:\n\nCapture. The abductee is forcibly taken from terrestrial surroundings to an apparent alien space craft.\nExamination. Invasive medical or scientific procedures are performed on the abductee.\nConference. The abductors speak to the abductee.\nTour. The abductees are given a tour of their captors\' vessel.\nLoss of Time. Abductees rapidly forget the majority of their experience.\nReturn. The abductees are returned to earth. Occasionally in a different location from where they were allegedly taken or with new injuries or disheveled clothing.\nTheophany. The abductee has a profound mystical experience, accompanied by a feeling of oneness with God or the universe.\nAftermath. The abductee must cope with the psychological, physical, and social effects of the experience.\n\n\n=== Nyman\'s alternate outline ===\nAbduction researcher Joe Nyman has composed a similar but alternative model for abduction narratives.\nAnxious Anticipation of Something Unknown. The abductee feels that something \"familiar yet unknown\" will soon occur.\nTransition of Consciousness and Immediate Aftermath. An altered state of consciousness overtakes the abductee rendering them docile and incapable of resistance.\nPsycho-physical Imposition and Interaction. Apparently alien beings forcibly perform medical and scientific procedures on the abductee.\nReassurance, Positive Feelings, and a Sense of Purpose Given. The captors suddenly act more benevolently and the experience takes a turn to the positive.\nTransition of Consciousness to Normal Waking. The altered state of consciousness induced in the second step ends.\nRapid Forgetfulness of Most or All Memory of Experience. Most memories of the experience fade.\nMarker Stage. Missing time noted, bizarre but seemingly non-sensical memories of being abducted by aliens are present. Sometimes there are recurring nightmares.\nCycle Interval. Normal life resumes until the next experience.When describing the \"abduction scenario\", David M. Jacobs says:\n\nThe entire abduction event is precisely orchestrated. All the procedures are predetermined. There is no standing around and deciding what to do next. The beings are task-oriented and there is no indication whatsoever that we have been able to find of any aspect of their lives outside of performing the abduction procedures.\n\nAlleged alien abductions are often closely connected to UFO reports, and are sometimes supposedly conducted by so-called Greys: Short, grey-skinned humanoids with large, pear-shaped heads and enormous dark eyes, although many different types of abducting entities have been reported, and the reported abductors seem to vary by the culture and place of origin of the experience.\n\n\n== Capture ==\nAbduction claimants report unusual feelings preceding the onset of an abduction experience. These feelings manifest as a compulsive desire to be at a certain place at a certain time or as expectations that something \"familiar yet unknown,\" will soon occur. Abductees also report feeling severe, undirected anxiety at this point even though nothing unusual has actually occurred yet. This period of foreboding can last for up to several days before the abduction actually takes place or be completely absent.Eventually, the experiencer will undergo an apparent \"shift\" into an altered state of consciousness. British abduction researchers have called this change in consciousness \"the Oz Factor.\" External sounds cease to have any significance to the experiencer and fall out of perception. They report feeling introspective and unusually calm. This stage marks a transition from normal activity to a state of \"limited self-willed mobility.\" As consciousness shifts one or more lights are alleged to appear, occasionally accompanied by a strange mist. The source and nature of the lights differ by report, sometimes the light emanates from a source outside the house (presumably the abductors\' UFO), sometimes the lights are in the bedroom with the experiencer and transform into alien figures.As the alleged abduction proceeds, claimants say they will walk or be levitated into an alien craft, often through solid objects like walls or a window.  Alternatively, they may experience rising through a tunnel with or without the abductors accompanying them into the awaiting craft.Most abductees report being taken from their bedroom prior to falling asleep. Typically, at the onset of the abduction experience, the abductee will report paralysis, sighting a bright light, and the appearance of humanoid figures.\nIn many abduction reports, the individual(s) concerned are traveling by automobile at the time of the incident, usually at night or in the early morning hours, and usually in a rural or sparsely populated area. A UFO will be seen ahead, (sometimes on the road) and the driver will either deliberately stop to investigate, or the car will stop due to apparent mechanical failure. Other forms of mechanical failure and interference are also common, such as a car radio producing static or behaving abnormally. In the occasions when they have been present, animals such as dogs usually also display a heightened fear response.\nSome reports indicate the alleged aliens, often the Greys using a pencil sized, black device with a light on the end of it, to make the abductee compliant (From Nick Pope\'s book The Uninvited (book))\nUpon getting out of the vehicle, the driver and passenger(s) often will experience a blank period and amnesia (see Missing Time), after which they will find themselves again standing in front of, or driving their car. While they frequently will not consciously remember the experience, either subsequent nightmares or hypnosis will reveal events interpreted as having occurred during the period lacking explicit memory.\n\n\n== Examination ==\nThe examination phase of the so-called \"abduction narrative\" is characterized by the performance of medical procedures and examinations by apparently alien beings against or irrespective to the will of the experiencer. Such procedures often focus on sex and reproductive biology. However, the literature holds reports of a wide variety of procedures allegedly performed by the beings. The entity that appears to be in charge of the operation is often taller than the others involved.Physician and abduction researcher Dr. John G. Miller explains that among abduction reports what stands out is the contrast between procedures performed by the alleged entities and those performed by doctors practicing typical earthly medicine. He says \"we\'re not hearing about \'our kind of medicine\'\" Miller believes these differences add credibility to claims of alien abductions because if they were hoaxes or confabulations the reports should more closely resemble the earthly medicine familiar to the claimants.Miller notes different areas of emphasis between human medicine and what is allegedly being practiced by the abductors. The abductors\' areas of interest appear to be the cranium (see below), nervous system, skin, reproductive system, and to a lesser degree, the joints. Systems given less attention than a human doctor would, or omitted entirely include cardiovascular system, the respiratory system below the pharynx and the lymphatic system. The abductors also appear to ignore the upper region of the abdomen in favor of the lower one.There are also differences in procedure as well as emphasis between human medicine and that claimed to be practiced by the entities. The abductors don\'t appear to wear gloves during the \"examination.\"  Other constants of terrestrial medicine like pills and tablets are missing from abduction narratives although sometimes abductees are asked to drink liquids. Injections also seem to be rare and IVs are almost completely absent. Dr. Miller says he\'s never heard an abductee claim to have a tongue depressor used on them.\n\n\n=== Cranial procedures ===\nYvonne Smith, a certified hypnotherapist and abduction researcher, notes that \"startling similarities\" between abductees reporting procedures performed on the head arise when comparing reports of hypnotically retrieved abduction memories. She states that the most commonly reported sensations and procedures performed to the head are feelings of pressure in or on the head and the insertion of needles into the scalp. During cranial procedures the abductee\'s head is often restrained by a strap or metal bar drawn across the forehead. The abductors sometimes will touch the forehead of the experiencer, which strangely, seems to ease their anxiety and whatever physical pain they may be experiencing.Reports of the entities drilling into the skull have also been given by several of Smith\'s clients. In one instance the claimed site of the drilling corresponded with an actual red mark on the back of experiencer\'s head. An attempt to document this mark photographically was made, but turned out unsuccessful. The same client reported smelling something burning upon the termination of the procedure. Smith has wondered if this could represent the being cauterizing the wound left by the drilling procedure by the abducting entities.Other common cranial procedures involve the ears. Reports of pressure or intense heat being experienced within one or both ears are the most common given during the hypnotic retrieval of memories. Experiencers have compared these sensations to the insertions of long needles and to having a high powered laser aimed into the ear.The insertion of long needle-like objects into the nasal passages is also common in reported abductions, and always allegedly performed without the aid of a speculum. This is quite unlike typical earthly medicine where a speculum would be used to allow doctors to see what they\'re doing. John G. Miller asserts \"We [terrestrial medical practitioners] certainly do not \'blindly\' insert long objects into our patients\' noses.\" He speculates that this probing may represent a biopsy of the olfactory mucous membrane. However, sometimes it is reported that these long probes are used to insert spherical metallic \"implants\" into the nasal cavity. Abductees reporting these implants often claim to experience nosebleeds after the alleged abduction.One of Smith\'s clients reported the removal of his skull cap and some sort of procedure being performed to his exposed brain with a needle-like instrument. The procedure reminded him of welding. One of his abductors tried to reassure him verbally while the apparent neurological procedure was being performed.\n\n\n=== Reproductive, gynecological and urological procedures ===\nMany female abductees report a \"gynecological\" aspect to the abduction experience, although staples of terrestrial gynecology such as the bimanual pelvic exam are missing from the alleged abduction experiences. Sometimes reports are made where the abductees are made to have sex with apparent human–alien hybrids or other abductees. David M. Jacobs says that sex with full-blooded aliens \"is not a feature of the abduction scenario.\" Males report that sperm is either taken and/or they have sex with the aliens. (From Nick Pope\'s book The Uninvited (book))\nOne procedure reported occurring during the alleged exam phase of the experience is the insertion of a long needle-like contraption into a woman\'s navel. Although most well known to have occurred in the Betty and Barney Hill abduction as a \"pregnancy test\", this feature has even been reported by little girls.\n\n\n=== Other procedures ===\nSkin scrapings are a staple of abduction reports from as far back as the Hill encounter. According to Richard Hall, most skin scrapings are reportedly taken from the arms and collar bone region. Physician and abduction researcher John Altshuler notes that the main reasons a human doctor would collect skin scrapings would be to check for bacterial or fungal infections. Altshuler dismisses speculation from other abduction researchers that the aliens are collecting the skin samples to analyze the DNA contained therein because the samples would not constitute \"a rich source of DNA.\"\n\n\n=== Reported devices and instruments ===\nWhen the Grey aliens encounter an abductee who will resist capture, is even combative, the aliens use a device that is black, cylindrical,  the size of a US No.#2 pencil, has a bluish light on one end. The alien fires this at the abductee to render the abductee compliant. It is like the \"phaser\" seen in the Star Trek franchise when being fired, (Source: Nick Pope\'s book The Uninvited (book)) only that it fires a bluish-white beam. It causes no pain, but numbs the human will.\nAlthough the chest is not an area of emphasis to the alleged abductors, it is sometimes reported that a device of some sort is placed on the chest. Physician and abduction researcher Dr. John G. Miller says that he can\'t distinguish whether this device is an EKG, chest X-ray or echocardiogram. Experiencers also sometimes report the being targeted by \"diffused colored lights\" during the examination. John G. Miller notes that phototherapy is rare in human medicine.When the abductors appear to use devices analogous to those used in human medicine, they are often quite different, for example, alleged alien syringes are often reported as being \"three pronged.\"\n\n\n== Subsequent abduction procedures ==\nAfter the so-called medical exam, the alleged abductees often report other procedures being performed with the entities. Common among these post-examination procedures are what abduction researchers refer to as imaging, envisioning, staging, and testing.\n\"Imaging\" procedures consist of an abductee being made to view screens displaying images and scenes that appear to be specially chosen with the intent to provoke certain emotional responses in the abductee. Commonly the images will show frightening scenes with themes of nuclear war, environmental disasters or similar calamities. Sometimes, though, the screens will display pleasant or mundane scenes.\n\"Envisioning\" is a similar procedure, with the primary difference being that the images being viewed, rather than being on a screen, actually seem to be projected into the experiencer\'s mind. While this occurs a small gray stares deeply into the abductee\'s eyes.\n\"Staging\" procedures have the abductee playing a more active role, according to reports containing this element. It shares vivid hallucination-like mental visualization with the envisioning procedures, but during staging the abductee interacts with the illusionary scenario like a role player or an actor. The abductors are alleged to be monitoring experiencers\' emotions during this procedure.\n\"Testing\" marks something of a departure from the above procedures in that it lacks the emotional analysis feature. During testing the experiencer is placed in front of a complicated electronic device and is instructed to operate it. The experiencer is often confused, saying that they don\'t know how to operate it. However, when they actually set about performing the task, the abductee will find that they do, in fact, know how to operate the machine.\n\n\n=== Child presentation ===\nAbductees of all ages (even small children) and genders sometimes report being subjected to a \"child presentation.\" As its name implies, the child presentation involves the abduction claimant being shown a \"child.\" Often the children appear to be neither human, nor the same species as the abductors. Instead, the child will almost always share characteristics of both species. These children are labeled by experiencers as hybrids between humans and their abductors, usually Greys. It has been speculated that these children are the products of the reproductive procedures performed during the medical phase of the abduction.Unlike Budd Hopkins and David Jacobs, folklorist Thomas Bullard could not identify a child presentation phase in the abduction narrative, even after undertaking a study of 300 abduction reports. Bullard says that the child presentation \"seems to be an innovation in the story.\" And that \"no clear antecedents\" to descriptions of the child presentation phase exists prior to its popularization by Hopkins and Jacobs.The hybrid children appearing in reported presentations vary in age and are often encountered over the course of several abductions. It is reported that they seem to age normally over the course of repeated alleged abductions. In reported abductions, after reaching adolescence the hybrids begin assisting the strange entities in administering the abduction procedure. Furthermore, when they reach adulthood, the hybrids become completely involved in the operation and will not be the subject of \"presentation\" to the abductee. Some abductees have reported being made to have sex with hybrids.The hybrid children are sometimes described as being kept in nurseries. There are usual 10-50 hybrids present, but some claimants have reported greater numbers. Some alleged abductees have reported \"incubatoria,\" where the walls are lined with fluid filled containers where developing hybrid fetuses are kept.When the child is presented to the abductee, the abductors appear to have specific expectations of what the abductee is to do with the child. Sometimes the abductee will be required to show affection towards the children by hugging them, or if presented with younger hybrids, to cradle them close to the body. Sometimes the hybrid will engage in a \"mindscan\" of the abductee. Female abductees have reported being ordered to breastfeed hybrid infants. The alleged experiencers\' reaction to this command varies, sometimes they comply, but some women are horrified by the thought.\n\n\n== Less common elements ==\nFolklorist Dr. Thomas E. Bullard conducted a study of 300 reports of alien abduction in an attempt to observe the less prominent aspects of the claims. He notes the emergence of four general categories of events which recur regularly, although not as frequently as stereotypical happenings like the medical examination. These four types of events are:\nThe conference\nThe tour\nThe journey\nTheophanyChronologically within abduction reports these rarer episodes tend to happen in the order listed, between the medical examination and the return.\n\n\n=== Conference ===\nAfter allegedly displaying cold callous disregard towards the abduction experiencers, sometimes the entities will change drastically in behavior once the initial medical exam is completed. They become more relaxed and hospitable towards their captive and lead him or her away from the site of the examination. The entities then hold a conference with the experiencer, wherein they discuss things relevant to the abduction phenomenon. In Dr. Bullard\'s study, 79 out of 300 studied abduction claims included a conference narrative. Not all conferences are reported to occur in the same manner. Bullard notes five general categories of discussion that occur during the conference \"phase\" of reported abduction narratives:\nInterrogation session\nExplanatory segment\nTask assignment\nWarnings\nPropheciesDuring an interrogation session one party involved in the abduction will question the other. This can mean that the witness is permitted to ask questions of his captors or that the entities will ask questions of the experiencer. The entities usually ask about aspects of human life that appear to puzzle them. Dr. Bullard notes, \"Time, life-spans, emotions and the individuality of humans seem to be recurrent topics.\"  The aliens also sometimes question the abductees about life on earth, or on their reproductive practices. In some cases, the aliens make inquiries about advanced scientific concepts, such as theoretical physics or neutron bomb technologies, apparently under the assumption that all humans are familiar with these concepts.The explanatory segment is a phase where the abductors will explain their motives to their captive, why the abductee was chosen as opposed to another human, or other things relating to the abduction phenomenon. Sometimes the entities will apologize for the cruel treatment they gave the abductee when they subjected them to being kidnapped and the medical examination. The entities often appear reluctant to disclose certain pieces of information, especially regarding their origins. Sometimes it seems like the entities are being dishonest towards the alleged experiencer. No two abduction claimants in the three hundred studied by Dr. Bullard gave identical places of origin for the aliens that allegedly abducted them.The task assignment phase, if present, involves a request or command from the abductors to the experiencer to be performed on their behalf. Usually the assigned task is some form of reconnaissance or information gathering, often related to human emotion or everyday life. Implicit in the assignment is the idea that the experiencer will be abducted again in the future.Warnings are sometimes given by the entities about the possibilities of future calamity resulting from current trends in human society such as warfare and the development of weapons of mass destruction or pollution and environmental concerns. Sometimes the entities go a step farther and issue specific prophecies of future disaster. The entities often claim that they will attempt to help humanity recover in the aftermath of the prophesied calamity. At times abduction claimants have reported that specific dates were given to them for a disaster to occur yet none of these specific prophecies has ever come to pass.\n\n\n=== Tour ===\nTours of the abductors\' craft are a rare but recurring feature of the abduction narrative. Thomas Bullard reports that in a study of 300 reported abduction events, only 16 contained some sort of tour. The tour seems to be given by the alleged abductors as a courtesy in response to the harshness and physical rigors of the forced medical examination.Abduction claimants often feel that the \"engine room\" is the most memorable aspect, although control rooms and in very rare cases living or recreation areas have been visited in some reports. The \"engine\" of the craft is sometimes described as being composed of \"crystals and rotor-like devices.\"\n\n\n=== Journey ===\nAlthough being transported from familiar terrestrial surroundings is an inherent part of the abduction phenomenon, some reports make claims of further transport when taken into the abductors\' vessel. Sometimes the abductee reports that this journey is constrained to earth or in orbit around it. However, there are reports of journeys to what appear to be other planets.When an otherworldly journey starts in these reports, the abductors often put the abductee in some sort of protective environment usually described as a chamber filled with liquid. In some bizarre cases, the travel isn\'t accomplished by means of the abductors\' vessel at all, but rather through some sort of out-of-body state.Once in motion, the vessel (often described as a UFO) will enter a \"mother ship\" or end up traveling underwater or underground to a strange, otherworldly location. This \"otherworld\" is often described as being a desert wasteland with a futuristic city. Occasionally the landscape is quite different from this, almost jungle-like, although the futuristic city is also present. Abductees have reported encountering other humans on these foreign worlds, or visiting zoos and museums.\n\n\n=== Theophany ===\nWhile some abductees find that the experience is terrifying, particularly if the aliens are of a more fearsome species, or if the abductee was subjected to extensive probing and medical testing, other abductees experience \"theophany\" — a sense of oneness with the universe or with God, described by Dr. Kenneth Ring as a \"greater awareness of the interconnectedness and sacredness of all life\". According to some researchers, theophanies are a rare feature of abduction reports. Only 6 of 300 reports in a study by Thomas Bullard volunteered information pertaining to this feature. Others researchers suggest that investigators have overlooked this feature; psychologist Susan A. Clancy, a skeptic at Harvard Medical School who studied abductees\' psychology, noted that \"all of the subjects, without exception, said they felt \'changed\' because of their experiences. ...Abductees have said, it \'enlarged my world view,\' \'gave me wisdom to share,\' \'caused me to care about the spiritual path of mankind,\' \'expanded my reality\'.\" \"Being abducted by aliens,\" she concludes, \"is a transformative event. ...It\'s clear that people get from their abduction beliefs the same things that millions of people the world over derive from their religions: meaning, reassurance, mystical revelation, spirituality, transformation.\" Some abduction-induced theophanies have included visions or insight into alien religions. It is not known whether this is a psychological phenomenon that occurs within the abductee due to their own beliefs, or if it is imparted to the abductee by the purported alien beings.\n\n\n== Return ==\nEventually the abductors will return the abductees to terra firma, usually to exactly the same location and circumstances they were in prior to being taken. Usually, explicit memories of the abduction experience will not be present, and the abductee will realize they\'ve experienced \"missing time\" upon checking a timepiece.Sometimes the alleged abductors appear to make mistakes when returning their captives. Famed UFO researcher Budd Hopkins has joked about \"the cosmic application of Murphy\'s Law\" in response to this observation. Hopkins has estimated that these \"errors\" accompany 4-5% of abduction reports. One type of common apparent mistake made by the abductors is failing to return the experiencer to the same spot that they were taken from initially. This can be as simple as a different room in the same house, or abductees can even find themselves outside and all the doors of the house are locked from the inside.David M. Jacobs recounts a report of a more severe \"wrong location\" mistake. She claims that she was driving and the next thing she knew, about 5 hours had passed. She was standing in the middle of a cornfield with her car nearby. There was no evidence that she had driven there as the stalks of corn were all intact and upright. Suddenly she loses consciousness briefly and then finds herself on the road driving again. It was as if the abductors had accidentally returned her to the wrong place, realized what they had done, and then corrected their mistake.Some abduction claimants have reported being returned to the correct location, but in a different circumstance. Common reports will have the abductee clothed when they went to bed, but nude when they awaken. Sometimes their clothes will be folded by their bedside, missing, or in rare cases, someone else\'s clothes will be there and their own clothing lost. Reports have been made of people awakening to find that their clothes are being worn improperly in bizarre ways (e.g. a long sleeve shirt apparently forced up over the legs like a pair of pants). The body or other objects may be covered with a fine dust.\nIt should be noted that some have speculated that these apparently bizarre, pointless behaviors were not mistakes at all.\n\n\n== Missing time ==\nDr. Don C. Donderi writes that \"In many of these abduction accounts, there is independent confirmation of missing time--emotionally stable people arriving hours late after long or short automobile journeys. There is independent confirmation of abduction events reported under hypnosis, sometimes by non hypnotized observers and sometimes by other hypnotized witnesses\" (Donderi, 66)\n\n\n== Realization event ==\nPhysician and abduction researcher John G. Miller sees significance in the reason a person would come to see themselves as being a victim of the abduction phenomenon. He terms the insight or development leading to this shift in identity from non-abductee to abductee the \"realization event.\" The realization event is often a single, memorable experience, but Miller reports that not all abductees experience it as a distinct episode. Either way, the realization event can be thought of as the \"clinical horizon\" of the abduction experience. Dr. Miller has compiled an incomplete list of common triggers for the realization event in a paper presented at the 1992 alien abduction conference held at MIT:\n\nTangible evidence, such as unexplained wounds or bodily changes or modification to the abductee\'s environment.\nConversations with other abductees or exposure to abduction claims.\nExposure to depictions of the abduction phenomenon in popular culture or the media.\nHypnotic retrieval of abduction memories.Sometimes the advent of the realization that one is an abductee can cause a \"flood\" of previously hidden memories of one\'s perceived encounters with \"the entities.\" Although the realization event is sometimes triggered by an attempt to hypnotically retrieve memories, it is frequently remembered consciously without any such assistance. Consequently, Miller sees it as a good \"starting point\" for a researcher investigating an individual subject.\n\n\n== Skeptical response ==\n\n\n=== Role of hypnosis and investigators in shaping the narrative ===\nSkeptics Robert Sheaffer and Phillip J. Klass agree that individual abduction researchers appear to exert influence on the characteristics of narratives retrieved during hypnotic recall. This influence tends to shape recovered abduction narratives in a way that reinforces the preconceived biases of the individual researcher. Klass jokingly recommends those considering hypnotic regression to uncover abduction memories to visit R. Leo Sprinkle, whose regression sessions more frequently \"uncover\" reports of benevolent aliens. Sheaffer also cites research done into hypnosis as a method for enhancing memory that concludes that false memories, subjectively real to the patient, can be created merely through suggestions while they are in a hypnotic trance.\n\n\n=== Effect of geography and culture on abduction reports ===\nAlthough proponents have argued that there is a core narrative consistent across abduction claims, there is little doubt that variation occurs in the details of reports across cultures and geographic boundaries. Skeptics like Robert Sheaffer assert that this variation supports a psycho-social hypothesis as an explanation for the origin of the abduction phenomenon. The quantity and not just quality of reports appears to be affected by culture as abduction reports are made less frequently in non-English speaking countries.Furthermore, the contents and structure of the \"abduction narrative\" as outlined by researchers like Nyman and Bullard was already established in fictional form by 1930 in a Buck Rogers strip.The strip depicts an alien craft piloted by martian \"Tiger Men\" which capture a female character and subject her to similar treatment as those in real-world abduction claims. The story is structurally more similar to the archetypal narrative outline devised by Bullard than the vast majority of those in Bullard\'s own catalogue of cases.However, Bullard does not see evidence for influence on abduction claimants from science fiction sources. In an essay, Bullard writes that \"The small showing for monstrous types and the fact that they concentrate in less reliable cases should disappoint skeptics who look for the origin of abductions in the influence of Hollywood. Nothing like the profusion of imaginative screen aliens appears in the abduction literature.\"There are however cultural differences in perception of these reported incidents. The frightening \"terror abduction\"  experience is reported mainly in the USA, while in the rest of the world, the ET encounters are said to be largely benevolent—this apparent incongruity perhaps raising a question as to the phenomenon\'s origins.\nAlthough in North America, \"aliens\" of extraterrestrial origin are the most commonly blamed in these incidents, in Europe and other parts of the world, the beings involved are as often perceived to be demonic or spiritual in origin. Common elements in the descriptions of abductions and visitations vary by region and local culture, with only a very few elements being the same worldwide, such as an otherworldly sensation, reports of mind control, repressed memories being rediscovered, and sexual experiences. These elements, and many aspects of what witnesses describe, are very common in old stories of encounters with faeries, demons, and other magical creatures.\n\nSkeptics argue that the raw details of abduction accounts have been featured in science fiction since at least the 1930s, and that these details have had widespread currency, thereby influencing and shaping expectations of what an encounter with extraterrestrials might entail. For example, a 1935 issue of Amazing Stories featured on its cover an illustration of a being with large eyes and a large head who was restraining a human from entering a room where another human was reclined on a table with another large-eyed creature examining her. See Rogerson\'s four-part article, and Martin Kottmeyer\'s \"Entirely Unpredisposed\" in external links.\nOthers have argued against this idea; folklorist Thomas E. Bullard asks, \"If Hollywood is responsible for these images, where are the monsters? Where are the robots?\" (Bryan, 50).\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==', '');

(45, 'History of alien abduction claims', 'History of alien abduction claims describes assertions or claims that people have experienced alien abduction. Such claims came to international prominence in the 1950s and 1960s, but some researchers argue abduction narratives can be traced to decades earlier. Such abduction stories have been studied by investigators who believe the accounts describe actual, literal interaction with non-human or extraterrestrial entities. Others have investigated alien abduction claims from a more skeptical perspective, arguing they can be best understood as expressions of folklore or various psychological phenomena.\nThe Antonio Vilas Boas case from Brazil (1957) and the Hill abduction from the United States (1961) were the first cases of UFO abduction to earn widespread attention. Though these two cases are sometimes viewed as the earliest abduction narratives, skeptic Peter Rogerson argues that this assertion is incorrect: the Hill and Boas abductions, he contends, were only the first \"canonical\" abduction cases, establishing a template that later abductees and researchers would refine, but rarely deviate from. Additionally, Rogerson notes purported abductions were cited contemporaneously at least as early as 1954, and that \"the growth of the abduction stories is a far more tangled affair than the \'entirely unpredisposed\' official history would have us believe.\" (The phrase \"entirely unpredisposed\" appeared in folklorist Thomas E. Bullard\'s study of alien abduction; he argued that alien abductions as reported in the 1970s and 1980s had little precedent in folklore or fiction.)\n\n\n== Paleo-abductions ==\nWhile \"alien abduction\" did not achieve widespread attention until the 1960s, there were many similar stories circulating decades earlier. These early abduction-like accounts have been dubbed \"paleo-abductions\" by UFO researcher Jerome Clark. This same two-part article ( and ) makes note of many paleo-abductions, some of which were reported well before the 1957 Antonio Vilas Boas case earned much attention, or even before the UFO report claimed in 1947 by pilot Kenneth Arnold that first generated widespread interest in UFOs:\n\nThere was at least one case of attempted abduction reported in conjunction with the mystery airships of the late 19th century. Colonel H. G. Shaw\'s account was published in the Stockton, California Daily Mail in 1897: Shaw claimed that he and a friend were harassed by three tall, slender humanoids whose bodies were covered with a fine, downy hair. The beings tried to  accost or kidnap Shaw and his friend, who were able to fight them off.\nIn his 1923 book, New Lands, American writer Charles Fort speculated that extraterrestrial beings might have kidnapped humans: \"One supposes that if extra-mundane vessels have sometimes come close to this earth, then sailing away, terrestrial aëronauts may have occasionally left this earth, or may have been seized and carried away from this earth.\"\nThe 1951 case of Fred Reagan, which was publicized by Flying Saucer Review in the late 1960s based on news clippings from 1952. Reagan claimed to have been piloting his small airplane, which was struck by a UFO; the occupants (who resembled metallic stalks of asparagus) apologised, and tried to cure Reagan\'s cancer. Reagan reportedly died of a brain disorder not long after the alleged UFO encounter.\nIn 1954, Paris Match printed a story said to have occurred in 1921, when the anonymous writer was a child. The writer claimed to have been snatched by two tall \"men\" who wore helmets and \"diving suits\" and who took the boy to an \"oddly shaped tank\" before being released. Rogerson calls this story \"the earliest known abduction survivor report.\"\nA 1958 letter to NICAP asserted that two U.S. Army soldiers witnessed two bright red lights near their base. The soldiers had a strange sense of dissociation, and found themselves in a new location, with no memory of how they arrived there.\nRogerson writes that the 1955 publication of Harold T. Wilkins\'s Flying Saucers Uncensored declared that two contactees, (Karl Hunrath and Wilbur Wilkinson) had disappeared under mysterious circumstances; Wilkins reported speculation that the duo were the victims of \"alleged abduction by flying saucers\".\nThe so-called Shaver Mystery of the 1940s has some similarities to later abduction accounts, as well, with sinister beings said to be kidnapping and torturing people. Rogerson writes that John Robinson (a friend of ufology gadfly Jim Moseley) made a 1957 appearance on John Nebel\'s popular overnight radio program to tell \"a dramatically spooky, if not very plausible, abduction tale\" related to the Shaver Mystery: Robinson claimed that a friend of his had been held captive by the evil Deros beneath the Earth, and to have been the victim of a sort of mind control via small \"earphones\"; Rogerson writes that \"in this unlikely tale that we first encounter the implants ...  and other abductionist staples.\"\n\n\n== Contactees ==\nThe UFO contactees of the 1950s claimed to have contacted aliens, and the substance of contactee narratives are often regarded as quite different from alien abduction accounts.\nHowever, Rogerson contends that it is often difficult to determine the division between contactees and abductees, with classification sometimes seeming arbitrary.\n\n\n== Two landmark cases ==\nAllegedly genuine stories of kidnap by extraterrestrials goes back at least to the mid-1950s, with the Antonio Vilas Boas case (which didn\'t receive much attention until they have several years later).Widespread publicity was generated by Betty and Barney Hill abduction case of 1961 (again not widely known until several years afterwards), culminating in a made-for-television film broadcast in 1975 (starring James Earl Jones and Estelle Parsons) dramatizing the events. The Hill incident was probably the prototypical abduction case, and was perhaps the first where:\n\nThe beings that later became widely known as the Greys appeared (who also went on to become the most common type of extraterrestrial in abduction reports).\nThe beings explicitly identified an extraterrestrial origin (the star Zeta Reticuli was later suspected as their point of origin).Neither the contactees nor these early abduction accounts, however, saw much attention from ufology, then still largely reluctant to consider close encounters of the third kind, where occupants of UFOs are allegedly interacted with.\nUndoubtedly, the Barney and Betty Hill case is one of, if not the  most famous case of purported abduction ever. Barney and Betty were driving home on a road free from other cars late one night. They both saw an odd light coming at them from above. They then blacked out and found themselves back on the road, driving. The only thing odd was it was two hours later than when they had seen the light. They both went to psychologists and hypnotists. They learned of the Grey on board the ship that had abducted them. See Barney and Betty Hill for more depth.\n\n\n== Later developments ==\nDr. R. Leo Sprinkle (a University of Wyoming psychologist) became interested in the abduction phenomenon in the 1960s. For some years, he was probably the only academic figure devoting any time to studying or researching abduction accounts. Sprinkle became convinced of the phenomenon\'s actuality, and was perhaps the first to suggest a link between abductions and cattle mutilation. Eventually Sprinkle came to believe that he had been abducted by aliens in his youth; he was forced from his job in 1989. (Bryan, 145fn)\nBudd Hopkins — a painter and sculptor by profession — had been interested in UFOs for some years. In the 1970s he became interested in abduction reports, and began using hypnosis to extract details of dimly remembered events. Hopkins soon became a figurehead of the growing abductee subculture. (Schnabel 1994)\nThe 1980s brought a major degree of mainstream attention to the subject. Works by Budd Hopkins, Whitley Strieber, David M. Jacobs and John E. Mack presented alien abduction as a genuine phenomenon. (Schnabel 1994)\nAlso of note in the 1980s was the publication of folklorist Dr. Thomas E. Bullard\'s comparative analysis of nearly 300 alleged abductees. The mid and late 1980s saw the involvement of two esteemed academic figures: Harvard psychiatrist John E. Mack and historian David M. Jacobs.\nWith Hopkins, Jacobs and Mack, several shifts occurred in the nature of the abduction narratives. There had been earlier abduction reports (the Hills being the best known), but they were believed to be few and far between, and saw rather little attention from ufology (and even less attention from mainstream professionals or academics). Jacobs and Hopkins argued that alien abduction was far more common than earlier suspected; they estimate that tens of thousands (or more) North Americans had been taken by unexplained beings. (Schnabel 1994)\nFurthermore, Jacobs and Hopkins argued that there was an elaborate scheme underway, that the aliens were attempting a program to create human–alien hybrids, though the motives for this scheme were unknown. There were anecdotal reports of phantom pregnancy related to UFO encounters at least as early as the 1960s, but Budd Hopkins and especially David M. Jacobs were instrumental in popularizing the idea of widespread, systematic interbreeding efforts on the part of the alien intruders. Despite the relative paucity of corroborative evidence, Jacobs presents this scenario as not only plausible, but self-evident. Hopkins and Jacobs have also been criticized for selective citation of abductee interviews, favoring those that support their hypothesis of extraterrestrial intervention.\nThe involvement of Jacobs and Mack marked something of a sea change in the abduction studies. Their efforts were controversial (both men saw some degree of damage to their professional reputations), but to other observers, Jacobs and Mack brought a degree of respectability to the subject.                                                             \n\n\n=== John E. Mack ===\nMatheson writes that \"if Jacobs\'s credentials were impressive,\" then those of Harvard psychiatrist John E. Mack might seem \"impeccable\" in comparison. (Matheson, 251) Mack was a well known, highly esteemed psychiatrist, author of over 150 scientific articles and winner of the Pulitzer Prize for his biography of T. E. Lawrence. Mack became interested in the phenomenon in the late 1980s, interviewing dozens of people, and eventually writing two books on the subject.\nMack was somewhat more guarded in his investigations and interpretations of the abduction phenomenon than the earlier researchers. Matheson writes that \"On balance, Mack does present as fair-minded an account as has been encountered to date, at least as these abduction narratives go.\" (Matheson, 251) Furthermore, Mack notes when alternative interpretations are viable; throughout Abduction, his first book on the subject, he allows and even considers likely that alien abductions are a new type of visionary experience.\nMatheson notes that unlike earlier abduction researchers, Mack is generally quite cautious in his interpretations of physical evidence and corroborative testimony. He places little value in the scars and scratches often attributed to alien \"medical\" exams, and argues that trying to prove the actuality of alleged \"implants\" placed in abductees is largely a futile effort.\nMack argued that the abduction phenomenon might be the beginning of a major paradigm shift in human consciousness, or \"a kind of fourth blow to our collective egoism, following those of Copernicus, Darwin and Freud.\" (Bryan, 270) Mack also noted that, after an initial period of terror and confusion (a phase he dubbed \"ontological shock\"), many abductees ultimately regard their experiences more positively, saying that their experiences broadened their consciousness.\nIn June 1992, Mack and physicist David E. Pritchard organized a five-day conference at MIT to discuss and debate the abduction phenomenon. The conference attracted a wide range of professionals, representing a variety of perspectives. (In response to this conference, Mack and Jacobs were awarded an Ig Nobel Prize in 1993.)\nWriter C. D. B. Bryan attended the conference, initially intending to gather information for a short humorous article for The New Yorker. While attending the conference, however, Bryan\'s view of the subject changed, and he wrote a serious, open-minded book on the phenomenon, additionally interviewing many abductees, skeptics, and proponents.\n\n\n=== David Icke and the global conspiracy ===\nDavid Icke is a British writer who proposed these two hypothesis about the alien abduction phenomena: \n\nthe abductions are strictly linked with military genetic experiments conducted by alien beings operating together with various terrestrial army forces;\ntherefore these abductions are only a part of a wider conspiracy.In Tales From The Time Loop and other works, Icke states that most organised religions, especially Christianity, Islam, and Judaism, are Illuminati creations designed to divide and conquer the human race through endless conflicts. In a similar vein, Icke believes racial and ethnic divisions are an illusion promoted by aliens, and that racism fuels the Illuminati agenda.\nAccording to David Icke the Global Elite controls the world using what he calls a \"pyramid of manipulation\" consisting of sets of hierarchical structures involving banking, business, the military, education, the media, religion, drug companies, intelligence agencies, and organised crime. At the very top of the pyramid are what Icke calls the \"Prison Warders,\" who are not human. He writes that: \"A pyramidal structure of human beings has been created under the influence and design of the extraterrestrial Prison Warders and their overall master, the Luciferic Consciousness. They control the human clique at the top of the pyramid, which I have dubbed the Global Elite.\"In 1999, Icke wrote and published The Biggest Secret: The Book that Will Change the World, in which he suggested that Earth is a zoo prison created by alien beings and identified the extraterrestrial prison warders as reptilians from the constellation Draco. They walk erect and appear to be human, living not only on the planets they come from, but also in caverns and tunnels under the earth.

DE LA GALISSONIERE, COMMANDANT GENERAL DE LA NOUVELLE FRANCE POVR RETABLIR LA TRAN QUILLITE DANS QUELQUES VILLAGES SAUVAGES DE CES CANTONS, AVONS ENTERRE CETTE PLAQUE AU CONFLUENT DE L\'OHIO ET DE TCHADAKOIN CE 29 JVILLET, PRES DE LA RIVIERE OYO AUTREMENT BELLE RIVIERE, POUR MONUMENT DU RENOUVELLEMENT DE POSSESSION QUE NOUS AVONS PRIS DE LA DITTE RIVIERE OYO, ET DE TOUTES CELLE~ QUI Y TOMBENT, ET DE TOUTES LES TERRES DES DEUX COTES JVSQVE AVX SOURCES DES DITTES RIVIERES AINSI QV\'EN ONT JOVY OU DV JOVIR LES PRECEDENTS ROIS DE FRANCE, ET QU\'ILS S\'Y SONT MAINTENVS PAR LES ARMES ET PAR LES TRAIT TES, SPECIALEMENT PAR CEVX DE RISWICK D\'VTRECHT ET D\'AIX LA CHAPELLE.(In the year 1749, in the reign of King Louis XV, we, Celeron, commander of a detachment sent by Commander de La Galissonière, Commander General of New France, for the restoration of peace in various untamed villages in the region, have buried this plaque at the confluence of the Ohio and Tchadakoin [Rivers] this 29th day of July near the fine river bank, to commemorate the retaking into possession of the afore-mentioned river bank and all the surrounding lands on both river shores back to the river sources, as secured by previous kings of France, and maintained by force of arms and by treaties, specifically the Treaties of Rijswick, of Utrecht and of Aix la Chapelle) Céloron\'s expedition was a diplomatic failure since the local tribes remained pro-English, and English representatives in the region refused to go away. This was, therefore, a prelude to a series of incidents that would lead to the loss of New France and the domination of eastern North America by the British Empire following the defeat of France in the French and Indian War (1754-1763).\nThe expedition can nevertheless be seen in more positive terms as a geographical project, since the Céloron expedition was the starting point for the first map of the Ohio Valley.  The map was the work of the Jesuit Joseph Pierre de Bonnecamps.\nIn 1770, Colonel George Washington visited the confluence that would become Point Pleasant, then proceeded 14 miles up the \"Great Kanawha\" and later reported that \"This Country abounds in Buffalo and Wild game of all kinds as also in all kinds of wild fowl, there being in the Bottoms a great many small grassy Ponds or Lakes which are full of Swans, Geese, and Ducks of different kinds.\"\n\n\n=== The Battle of Point Pleasant (1774) ===\n\nIn the Battle of Point Pleasant (October 10, 1774), fought on the future site of the town, over one thousand Virginia militiamen, led by Colonel Andrew Lewis (1720–1781), defeated a roughly equal force of an Algonquin confederation of Shawnee and Mingo warriors led by Shawnee Chief Cornstalk (c. 1720-1777). The event is celebrated locally as the \"First Battle of the American Revolutionary War\" and in 1908 the U.S. Senate authorized erection of a local monument to commemorate it as such. Most historians, however, regard it not as a battle of the Revolution (1775–1783), but as a part of Lord Dunmore\'s War (1774).\n\n		\n\n\n=== Settlement ===\n\"Camp Point Pleasant\" was established by Col. Lewis at the time of the Battle and the settlement that followed also took that name. Although not certain, Point Pleasant may have been permanently settled by whites as early as 1774. A permanent stockade known as Fort Blair was erected there at about that time. Prior to that, hostilities between whites and Indians all along the Ohio River Valley probably precluded the possibility of settlement in the absence of a substantial stockade. In 1776, a new fort was built on the site of the earlier fort and named for the recently deceased Virginia official Peyton Randolph (1721–1775). Fort Randolph is best remembered as the place where Chief Cornstalk was murdered in 1777. It withstood attack by Indians the following year, but was abandoned in 1779.\nGeorge Washington\'s 1770 journey to the Ohio River Valley had been occasioned by military grants that had been awarded by proclamation in 1754 by Governor Dinwiddie to officers and soldiers who had served in the French and Indian War. The resulting survey encompassed 52,302 acres (or 80 square miles) and was subdivided in the 1780s as follows: 9,876 acres — including the present side of Point Pleasant — to Andrew Lewis, 5,000 acres for George Muse, 5,000 acres for Peter Hogg, 8,000 acres for Andrew Stephens, another 3,000 acres for Peter Hogg, another 5,026 acres for George Muse, 3,400 acres for Andrew Waggener, 6,000 acres for John Poulson, 6,000 acres for John West. On the lower side of the Kanawha River, 13,532 acres for Hugh Mercer (see Mercers Bottom) and, finally, 10,990 acres for Washington himself.\nFort Randolph was rebuilt nearby in 1785 after the renewal of hostilities between the United States government and the Indians, but saw little action and was eventually abandoned once again. The settlement at Point Pleasant did not receive an official charter until 1794.\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\nMason County was carved out of Kanawha County in 1804 and Point Pleasant was designated the county seat at that time. According to historian Virgil A. Lewis, \"Point Pleasant did not flourish for many years [after the turn of the century]. There was no church for more than fifty years and society was at a low ebb. There was a popular superstition that because of the fiendish murder of Cornstalk there in 1777, the place was laid under a curse for a hundred years\". Lewis also relates that a visitor to Point Pleasant in 1810 observed that ... Point Pleasant is pleasantly situated immediately above the mouth of the Great Kanawha, on an extensive and fertile bottom of the Ohio, of which it has a fine prospect up and down that river. It is the seat of justice of Mason county Virginia, and contains about 15 or 20 families, a log courthouse, a log jail and as usual (but unfortunately) in the Virginia towns, a pillory and whipping post. Point Pleasant seems rather on the stand in point of improvement, arising, it is said, from the difficulty in establishing the land titles. It is, however, a considerable place of embarkation for those descending the Ohio from the back and western parts of Virginia. There is one merchant. Mr. William Langtry.\nPoint Pleasant was incorporated in 1833.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\nPoint Pleasant was widely noted for the 1967 collapse of the Silver Bridge, which killed 46 people.\nOn October 10, 1974, Point Pleasant celebrated the 200th anniversary of the Battle of Point Pleasant. A replica of Fort Randolph was built in 1973-74 and dedicated as part of the festivities. The town of Point Pleasant was situated over the site of the fort and so the replica is located at Krodel Park, about one mile away.\n\n\n=== National Register of Historic Places ===\nThe Eastham House, Lewis-Capehart-Roseberry House, and Point Pleasant Battleground are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  The central business district and surrounding residential areas are included in the Point Pleasant Historic District.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\nAmong the early settlers at Point Pleasant was Samuel B. Clemens and his wife Pamela (née Goggin), grandparents of the celebrated author Mark Twain. They had migrated from Campbell County, Virginia and, according to family tradition, Samuel was killed in 1805 by a falling log at a house raising there.\nPoint Pleasant was the final home of Confederate Brigadier-General John McCausland, the next-to-last Confederate General to die. He died at his farm at Grimm\'s Landing on January 23, 1927, and is buried in nearby Henderson.\nKarl Probst, born in Point Pleasant, was an automotive engineer credited in 1940 with the design of the Jeep.\nThe Shawnee Chief Cornstalk was taken prisoner and later killed by an angry mob at Fort Randolph on 10 November 1777.\n\n\n== Folklore ==\n\n\n=== The Mothman ===\nParanormal enthusiasts flock to Point Pleasant in search of Mothman, a creature said to be a harbinger of imminent disaster that inhabits an abandoned TNT factory from World War II. John Keel published a book in 1975 entitled The Mothman Prophecies, and a film inspired by the novel was released in January 2002. Later, another film, loosely based on the legend, was also released. The town is host to a Mothman Museum, and every year it holds a Mothman Festival that features tours, pageants, balls, films, music, and other events to celebrate what they consider \"one of Point Pleasant\'s largest tourist attractions.\"\n\n\n== Climate ==\nThe climate in this area is characterized by evenly distributed precipitation throughout the year.  According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Point Pleasant has a Humid continental climate, abbreviated \"Cfa\" on climate maps.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of cities and towns along the Ohio River\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCity of Point Pleasant\nMason County Convention and Visitors Bureau\nMason County Area Chamber of Commerce\nPoint Pleasant Internet Directory\nThe Point Pleasant Register', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0b/Dunmore_Saga.png'),

The case was listed in the U.S. Air Force\'s Project Blue Book as an \"unknown.\"Donald Howard Menzel in his book The World of Flying Saucers (1963) suggested some possible naturalistic explanations. He suggested that the pilots may have seen lights on the ground that were distorted by haze.

(48, 'UFO sightings in outer space', 'UFO sightings in outer space are sightings of unidentified flying objects reported by astronauts while in space that they could not explain at the time. These sightings have been claimed as evidence for alien visits by ufologists. Some of the alleged sightings never occurred: science fiction writer Otto Binder perpetuated a hoax claiming Apollo 11 Commander Neil Armstrong had encountered UFOs during the Apollo mission. UFO proponents see comments by astronauts or photos processed by NASA as one of the \"strongest bodies of evidence\" because they are considered to be of high trustworthiness; however, NASA Assistant Administrator for Legislative Affairs, Robert F. Allnut, concluded in a 1970 letter, \"after fifteen years of manned space voyages including space stations and landing on the Moon, spacemen have brought back not a shred of evidence -- verbal, photographic, or otherwise -- for the existence of extraterrestrial spacecraft, or \'UFOs\'.\"In 2009, footage from NASA was posted on YouTube by ufologists which \"renew[ed] UFO conspiracy theories that the government is hiding knowledge about its interactions with intelligent life\" by relying on a \"lack of context\" to promote a \"collection of indistinct imagery and allegations\". A number of the incidents were collected for an episode of the 2014 television series Are We Alone?.\n\n\n== Incidents ==\nSome sightings involving astronauts or NASA include:\nDuring the Gemini 4 mission, pilot Jim McDivitt spotted an object that he described as a \"white cylindrical shape with a white pole sticking out of one corner of it.\" He took two pictures of it. His partner, Ed White, was asleep at the time. McDivitt maintains that it was some unknown but man-made piece of debris, while James Oberg argues that it was most likely the Titan II second stage of the craft.In a transcript of Gemini 7 mission, the astronauts mention a \"bogey\" which ufologists have claimed was a reference to a UFO. Oberg, based on his trajectory analysis of the  mission, describes the astronauts\' comments about a \"bogey\" as referring to booster-associated debris, and not a reference to some sort of UFO. The astronaut who made the comments, Frank Borman, later confirmed that what he saw was not a UFO, and that when he offered to go on the television show Unsolved Mysteries to clarify, the producers told him, \"Well, I\'m not sure we want you on the program.\"Within the UFO community, stories have spread that Neil Armstrong was reported to have witnessed multiple UFOs during Apollo 11. An explanation was that the sightings could have been attributed to jettisoned components. Additional stories were accredited to a hoax spread by science fiction writer Otto Binder. Buzz Aldrin says his words were taken out of context from an interview in 2005 about the incident.During a 2005 spacewalk outside the International Space Station, astronaut Leroy Chiao reported seeing lights  in a formation he described as \"in a line\" and \"almost like an upside-down check mark\". The incident was promoted as a possible UFO sighting in the television series Are We Alone?.   Chiao later identified the lights as being from  fishing boats \"hundreds of miles below\".In August 2013, according to NASA TV, astronaut Christopher Cassidy saw a UFO float past the International Space Station near its Progress 52 cargo ship. It was soon identified by Russian flight controllers as an antenna cover from the Zvezda service module.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of reported UFO sightings\nSTS-48#Ice particles\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMorrison, David (2 October 2006). \"Buzz Aldrin\'s UFO Sighting\".

The program was first made public on December 16, 2017. The program began in 2007, with funding of $22 million over the five years until the available appropriations were ended in 2012. The program began in the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency.

(50, 'Ural Mountains', 'The Ural Mountains (; Russian: Ура́льские го́ры, tr. Uralskiye gory, IPA: [ʊˈralʲskʲɪjə ˈgorɨ]; Bashkir: Урал тауҙары, Ural tauźarı), or simply the Urals, are a mountain range that runs approximately from north to south through western Russia, from the coast of the Arctic Ocean to the Ural River and northwestern Kazakhstan.\nThe mountain range forms part of the conventional boundary between the continents of Europe and Asia. Vaygach Island and the islands of Novaya Zemlya form a further continuation of the chain to the north into the Arctic Ocean.\nThe mountains lie within the Ural geographical region and significantly overlap with the Ural Federal District and with the Ural economic region. They have rich resources, including metal ores, coal, and precious and semi-precious stones. Since the 18th century the mountains have contributed significantly to the mineral sector of the Russian economy.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nAs attested by Sigismund von Herberstein, in the 16th century Russians called the range by a variety of names derived from the Russian words for rock (stone) and belt. The modern Russian name for the Urals (Урал, Ural), first appearing in the 16th–17th century when the Russian conquest of Siberia was in its heroic phase, was initially applied to its southern parts and gained currency as the name of the entire range during the 18th century. It might have been a borrowing from either Turkic \"stone belt\" (Bashkir, where the same name is used for the range), or Ob-Ugric. From the 13th century, in Bashkortostan there has been a legend about a hero named Ural. He sacrificed his life for the sake of his people and they poured a stone pile over his grave, which later turned into the Ural Mountains. Possibilities include Bashkir үр \"elevation; upland\" and Mansi ур ала \"mountain peak, top of the mountain\", V.N. Tatischev believes that this oronym is set to \"belt\" and associates it with the Turkic verb oralu- \"gird\". I.G. Dobrodomov suggests a transition from Aral to Ural explained on the basis of ancient Bulgar-Chuvash dialects. Geographer E.V. Hawks believes that the name goes back to the Bashkir folklore Ural-Batyr. The Evenk geographical term era \"mountain\" has also been theorized. Finno-Ugrist scholars consider Ural deriving from the Ostyak word urr meaning \"chain of mountains\". Turkologists, on the other hand, have achieved majority support for their assertion that \'ural\' in Tatar means a belt, and recall that an earlier name for the range was \'stone belt\'.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nAs Middle-Eastern merchants traded with the Bashkirs and other people living on the western slopes of the Ural as far north as Great Perm, since at least the 10th century medieval mideastern geographers had been aware of the existence of the mountain range in its entirety, stretching as far as to the Arctic Ocean in the north. The first Russian mention of the mountains to the east of the East European Plain is provided by the Primary Chronicle, when it describes the Novgorodian expedition to the upper reaches of the Pechora in 1096. During the next few centuries Novgorodians engaged in fur trading with the local population and collected tribute from Yugra and Great Perm, slowly expanding southwards. The rivers Chusovaya and Belaya were first mentioned in the chronicles of 1396 and 1468, respectively. In 1430 the town of Solikamsk (Kama Salt) was founded on the Kama at the foothills of the Ural, where salt was produced in open pans. Ivan III of Moscow captured Perm, Pechora and Yugra from the declining Novgorod Republic in 1472. With the excursions of 1483 and 1499–1500 across the Ural Moscow managed to subjugate Yugra completely.\n\nNevertheless, around that time early 16th century Polish geographer Maciej of Miechów in his influential Tractatus de duabus Sarmatiis (1517) argued that there were no mountains in Eastern Europe at all, challenging the point of view of some authors of Classical antiquity, popular during the Renaissance. Only after Sigismund von Herberstein in his Notes on Muscovite Affairs (1549) had reported, following Russian sources, that there are mountains behind the Pechora and identified them with the Ripheans and Hyperboreans of ancient authors, did the existence of the Ural, or at least of its northern part, become firmly established in the Western geography. The Middle and Southern Ural were still largely unavailable and unknown to the Russian or Western European geographers.\n\nIn the 1550s, after the Tsardom of Russia had defeated the Khanate of Kazan and proceeded to gradually annex the lands of the Bashkirs, the Russians finally reached the southern part of the mountain chain. In 1574 they founded Ufa. The upper reaches of the Kama and Chusovaya in the Middle Ural, still unexplored, as well as parts of Transuralia still held by the hostile Siberian Khanate, were granted to the Stroganovs by several decrees of the tsar in 1558–1574. The Stroganovs\' land provided the staging ground for Yermak\'s incursion into Siberia. Yermak crossed the Ural from the Chusovaya to the Tagil around 1581. In 1597 Babinov\'s road was built across the Ural from Solikamsk to the valley of the Tura, where the town of Verkhoturye (Upper Tura) was founded in 1598. Customs was established in Verkhoturye shortly thereafter and the road was made the only legal connection between European Russia and Siberia for a long time. In 1648 the town of Kungur was founded at the western foothills of the Middle Ural. During the 17th century the first deposits of iron and copper ores, mica, gemstones and other minerals were discovered in the Ural.\nIron and copper smelting works emerged. They multiplied particularly quickly during the reign of Peter I of Russia. In 1720–1722 he commissioned Vasily Tatishchev to oversee and develop the mining and smelting works in the Ural. Tatishchev proposed a new copper smelting factory in Yegoshikha, which would eventually become the core of the city of Perm and a new iron smelting factory on the Iset, which would become the largest in the world at the time of construction and give birth to the city of Yekaterinburg. Both factories were actually founded by Tatishchev\'s successor, Georg Wilhelm de Gennin, in 1723. Tatishchev returned to the Ural on the order of Empress Anna to succeed de Gennin in 1734–1737. Transportation of the output of the smelting works to the markets of European Russia necessitated the construction of the Siberian Route from Yekaterinburg across the Ural to Kungur and Yegoshikha (Perm) and further to Moscow, which was completed in 1763 and rendered Babinov\'s road obsolete. In 1745 gold was discovered in the Ural at Beryozovskoye and later at other deposits. It has been mined since 1747.\nThe first ample geographic survey of the Ural Mountains was completed in the early 18th century by the Russian historian and geographer Vasily Tatishchev under the orders of Peter I. Earlier, in the 17th century, rich ore deposits were discovered in the mountains and their systematic extraction began in the early 18th century, eventually turning the region into the largest mineral base of Russia.One of the first scientific descriptions of the mountains was published in 1770–71. Over the next century, the region was studied by scientists from a number of countries, including Russia (geologist Alexander Karpinsky, botanist Porfiry Krylov and zoologist Leonid Sabaneyev), the United Kingdom (geologist Sir Roderick Murchison), France (paleontologist Édouard de Verneuil), and Germany (naturalist Alexander von Humboldt, geologist Alexander Keyserling). In 1845, Murchison, who  had according to Encyclopædia Britannica \"compiled the first geologic map of the Ural in 1841\", published The Geology of Russia in Europe and the Ural Mountains with de Verneuil and Keyserling.The first railway across the Ural had been built by 1878 and linked Perm to Yekaterinburg via Chusovoy, Kushva and Nizhny Tagil. In 1890 a railway linked Ufa and Chelyabinsk via Zlatoust. In 1896 this section became a part of the Trans-Siberian Railway. In 1909 yet another railway connecting Perm and Yekaterinburg passed through Kungur by the way of the Siberian Route. It has eventually replaced the Ufa – Chelyabinsk section as the main trunk of the Trans-Siberian railway.\nThe highest peak of the Ural, Mount Narodnaya, (elevation 1,895 m (6,217 ft)) was identified in 1927.\n\nDuring the Soviet industrialization in the 1930s the city of Magnitogorsk was founded in the South-Eastern Ural as a center of iron smelting and steelmaking. During the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941–1942, the mountains became a key element in Nazi planning for the territories which they expected to conquer in the USSR. Faced with the threat of having a significant part of the Soviet territories occupied by the enemy, the government evacuated many of the industrial enterprises of European Russia and Ukraine to the eastern foothills of the Ural, considered a safe place out of reach of the German bombers and troops. Three giant tank factories were established at the Uralmash in Sverdlovsk (as Yekaterinburg used to be known), Uralvagonzavod in Nizhny Tagil, and Chelyabinsk Tractor Plant in Chelyabinsk. After  the war, in 1947–1948, Chum – Labytnangi railway, built with the forced labor of Gulag inmates, crossed the Polar Ural.\nMayak, 150 km southeast of Yekaterinburg, was a center of the Soviet nuclear industry and site of the Kyshtym disaster.\n\n\n== Geography and topography ==\nThe Ural Mountains extend about 2,500 km (1,600 mi) from the Kara Sea to the Kazakh Steppe along the northern border of Kazakhstan. Vaygach Island and the island of Novaya Zemlya form a further continuation of the chain on the north. Geographically this range marks the northern part of the border between the continents of Europe and Asia. Its highest peak is Mount Narodnaya, approximately 1,895 m (6,217 ft) in elevation.\n\nBy topography and other natural features, the Urals are divided, from north to south, into the Polar (or Arctic), Nether-Polar (or Sub-Arctic), Northern, Central and Southern parts.\n\n\n=== Polar Ural ===\nThe Polar Urals extend for about 385 kilometers (239 mi) from Mount Konstantinov Kamen in the north to the Khulga River in the south; they have an area of about 25,000 km2 (9,700 sq mi) and a strongly dissected relief. The maximum height is 1,499 m (4,918 ft) at Payer Mountain and the average height is 1,000 to 1,100 m (3,300 to 3,600 ft).\nThe mountains of the Polar Ural have exposed rock with sharp ridges, though flattened or rounded tops are also found.\n\n\n=== Nether-polar Ural ===\n\nThe Nether-Polar Ural are higher, and up to 150 km (93 mi) wider than the Polar Urals. They include the highest peaks of the range: Mount Narodnaya (1,895 m (6,217 ft)), Mount Karpinsky (1,878 m (6,161 ft)) and Manaraga (1,662 m (5,453 ft)). They extend for more than 225 km (140 mi) south to the Shchugor River. The many ridges are sawtooth shaped and dissected by river valleys. Both Polar and Nether-Polar Urals are typically Alpine; they bear traces of Pleistocene glaciation, along with permafrost and extensive modern glaciation, including 143 extant glaciers.\n\n\n=== Northern Ural ===\nThe Northern Ural consist of a series of parallel ridges up to 1,000–1,200 m (3,300–3,900 ft) in height and longitudinal hollows. They are elongated from north to south and stretch for about 560 km (350 mi) from the Usa River. Most of the tops are flattened, but those of the highest mountains, such as Telposiz, 1,617 m (5,305 ft) and Konzhakovsky Stone, 1,569 m (5,148 ft) have a dissected topography. Intensive weathering has produced vast areas of eroded stone on the mountain slopes and summits of the northern areas.\n\n\n=== Middle Ural ===\nThe Central Ural are the lowest part of the Ural, with smooth mountain tops, the highest mountain being 994 m (3,261 ft) (Basegi); they extend south from the Ufa River.\n\n\n=== Southern Ural ===\n\nThe relief of the Southern Ural is more complex, with numerous valleys and parallel ridges directed south-west and meridionally.  The range includes the Ilmensky Mountains separated from the main ridges by the Miass River. The maximum height is 1,640 m (5,380 ft) (Mount Yamantau) and the width reaches 250 km (160 mi). Other notable peaks lie along the Iremel mountain ridge (Bolshoy Iremel and Maly Iremel). The Southern Urals extend some 550 km (340 mi) up to the sharp westward bend of the Ural River and terminate in the wide Mughalzhar Hills.\n\n\n== Geology ==\n\nThe Urals are among the world\'s oldest extant mountain ranges. For its age of 250 to 300 million years of age, the elevation of the mountains is unusually high. They were formed during the Uralian orogeny due to the collision of the eastern edge of the supercontinent Laurussia with the young and rheologically weak continent of Kazakhstania, which now underlies much of Kazakhstan and West Siberia west of the Irtysh, and intervening island arcs. The collision lasted nearly 90 million years in the late Carboniferous – early Triassic. Unlike the other major orogens of the Paleozoic (Appalachians, Caledonides, Variscides), the Urals have not undergone post-orogenic extensional collapse and are unusually well preserved for their age, being underlaid by a pronounced crustal root. East and south of the Urals much of the orogen is buried beneath later Mesozoic and Cenozoic sediments. The adjacent Pay-Khoy Ridge to the north and Novaya Zemlya are not a part of the Uralian orogen and formed later.\nMany deformed and metamorphosed rocks, mostly of Paleozoic age, surface within the Urals. The sedimentary and volcanic layers are folded and faulted. The sediments to the west of the Ural Mountains are formed of limestone, dolomite and sandstone left from ancient shallow seas. The eastern side is dominated by basalts.\n\nThe western slope of the Ural Mountains has predominantly karst topography, especially in the Sylva River basin, which is a tributary of the Chusovaya River. It is composed of severely eroded sedimentary rocks (sandstones and limestones) that are about 350 million years old.  There are many caves, sinkholes and underground streams. The karst topography is much less developed on the eastern slopes. The eastern slopes are relatively flat, with some hills and rocky outcrops and contain alternating volcanic and sedimentary layers dated to the middle Paleozoic Era. Most high mountains consist of weather-resistant rocks such as quartzite, schist and gabbro that are between 570 and 395 million years old. The river valleys are underlain by limestone.The Ural Mountains contain about 48 species of economically valuable ores and economically valuable minerals. Eastern regions are rich in chalcopyrite, nickel oxide, gold, platinum, chromite and magnetite ores, as well as in coal (Chelyabinsk Oblast), bauxite, talc, fireclay and abrasives. The Western Urals contain deposits of coal, oil, natural gas (Ishimbay and Krasnokamsk areas) and potassium salts. Both slopes are rich in bituminous coal and lignite, and the largest deposit of bituminous coal is in the north (Pechora field). The specialty of the Urals is precious and semi-precious stones, such as emerald, amethyst, aquamarine, jasper, rhodonite, malachite and diamond. Some of the deposits, such as the magnetite ores at Magnitogorsk, are already nearly depleted.\n\n\n== Rivers and lakes ==\n\nMany rivers originate in the Ural Mountains. The western slopes south of the border between the Komi Republic and Perm Krai and the eastern slopes south of approximately 54°30\'N drain into the Caspian Sea via the Kama and Ural River basins. The tributaries of the Kama include the Vishera, Chusovaya, and Belaya and originate on both the eastern and western slopes. The rest of the Urals drain into the Arctic Ocean, mainly via the Pechora basin in the west, which includes the Ilych, Shchugor, and the Usa, and via the Ob basin in the east, which includes the Tobol, Tavda, Iset, Tura and Severnaya Sosva. The rivers are frozen for more than half the year. Generally, the western rivers have higher flow volume than the eastern ones, especially in the Northern and Nether-Polar regions. Rivers are slower in the Southern Urals. This is because of low precipitation and the relatively warm climate resulting in less snow and more evaporation.The mountains contain a number of deep lakes. The eastern slopes of the Southern and Central Urals have most of these, among the largest of which are the Uvildy, Itkul, Turgoyak, and Tavatuy lakes. The lakes found on the western slopes are less numerous and also smaller. Lake Bolshoye Shchuchye, the deepest lake in the Polar Urals, is 136 meters (446 ft) deep. Other lakes, too, are found in the glacial valleys of this region. Spas and sanatoriums have been built to take advantage of the medicinal muds found in some of the  mountain lakes.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nThe climate of the Urals is continental. The mountain ridges, elongated from north to south, effectively absorb sunlight thereby increasing the temperature. The areas west of the Ural Mountains are 1–2 °C (1.8–3.6 °F) warmer in winter than the eastern regions because the former are warmed by Atlantic winds whereas the eastern slopes are chilled by Siberian air masses. The average January temperatures increase in the western areas from −20 °C (−4 °F) in the Polar to −15 °C (5 °F) in the Southern Urals and the corresponding temperatures in July are 10 °C (50 °F) and 20 °C (68 °F). The western areas also receive more rainfall than the eastern ones by 150–300 mm (5.9–11.8 in) per year. This is because the mountains trap clouds from the Atlantic Ocean. The highest precipitation, approximately 1,000 mm (39 in), is in the Northern Urals with up to 1,000 cm (390 in) snow. The eastern areas receive from 500–600 mm (20–24 in) in the north to 300–400 mm (12–16 in) in the south. Maximum precipitation occurs in the summer: the winter is dry because of the Siberian High.\n\n\n== Flora ==\n\nThe landscapes of the Urals vary with both latitude and longitude and are dominated by forests and steppes. The southern area of the Mughalzhar Hills is a semidesert. Steppes lie mostly in the southern and especially south-eastern Urals. Meadow steppes have developed on the lower parts of mountain slopes and are covered with zigzag and mountain clovers, Serratula gmelinii, dropwort, meadow-grass and Bromus inermis, reaching the height of 60–80 cm. Much of the land is cultivated. To the south, the meadow steppes become more sparse, dry and low. The steep gravelly slopes of the mountains and hills of the eastern slopes of the Southern Urals are mostly covered with rocky steppes. River valleys contain willow, poplar and caragana shrubs.Forest landscapes of the Urals are diverse, especially in the southern part. The western areas are dominated by dark coniferous taiga forests which change to mixed and deciduous forests in the south. The eastern mountain slopes have light coniferous taiga forests. The Northern Urals are dominated by conifers, namely Siberian fir, Siberian pine, Scots pine, Siberian spruce, Norway spruce and Siberian larch, as well as by silver and downy birches. The forests are much sparser in the Polar Urals. Whereas in other parts of the Ural Mountains they grow up to an altitude of 1000 m, in the Polar Urals the tree line is at 250–400 m. The polar forests are low and are mixed with swamps, lichens, bogs and shrubs. Dwarf birch, mosses and berries (blueberry, cloudberry, black crowberry, etc.) are abundant. The forests of the Southern Urals are the most diverse in composition: here, together with coniferous forests are also abundant broadleaf tree species such as English oak, Norway maple and elm. The Virgin Komi Forests in the northern Urals are recognized as a World Heritage site.\n\n\n== Fauna ==\nThe Ural forests are inhabited by animals typical of Siberia, such as elk, brown bear, fox, wolf, wolverine, lynx, squirrel, and sable (north only). Because of the easy accessibility of the mountains there are no specifically mountainous species. In the Middle Urals, one can see a rare mixture of sable and pine marten named kidus. In the Southern Urals, badger and black polecat are common. Reptiles and amphibians live mostly in the Southern and Central Ural and are represented by the common viper, lizards and grass snakes. Bird species are represented by capercaillie, black grouse, hazel grouse, spotted nutcracker, and cuckoos. In summers, the South and Middle Urals are visited by songbirds, such as nightingale and redstart.The steppes of the Southern Urals are dominated by hares and rodents such as gophers, susliks, and jerboa. There are many birds of prey such as lesser kestrel and buzzards. The animals of the Polar Urals are few and are characteristic of the tundra; they include Arctic fox, lemming, and reindeer. The birds of these areas include rough-legged buzzard, snowy owl, tundra partridge, and rock ptarmigan.\n\n\n== Ecology ==\nThe continuous and intensive economic development of the last centuries has affected the fauna, and wildlife is much diminished around all industrial centers. During World War II, hundreds of factories were evacuated from Western Russia before the German occupation, flooding the Urals with industry. The conservation measures include establishing national wildlife parks. There are nine strict nature reserves in the Urals: the Ilmen, the oldest one, mineralogical reserve founded in 1920 in Chelyabinsk Oblast, Pechora-Ilych in the Komi Republic, Bashkir and its former branch Shulgan-Tash in Bashkortostan, Visim in Sverdlovsk Oblast, Southern Ural in Bashkortostan, Basegi in Perm Krai, Vishera in Perm Krai and Denezhkin Kamen in Sverdlovsk Oblast.\nThe area has also been severely damaged by the plutonium-producing facility Mayak opened in Chelyabinsk-40 (later called Chelyabinsk-65, Ozyorsk), in the Southern Ural, after World War II. Its plants went into operation in 1948 and, for the first ten years, dumped unfiltered radioactive waste into the Techa River and Lake Karachay. In 1990, efforts were underway to contain the radiation in one of the lakes, which was estimated at the time to expose visitors to 500 millirem per day. As of 2006, 500 mrem in the natural environment was the upper limit of exposure considered safe for a member of the general public in an entire year (though workplace exposure over a year could exceed that by a factor of 10). Over 23,000 km2 (8,900 sq mi) of land were contaminated in 1957 from a storage tank explosion, only one of several serious accidents that further polluted the region. The 1957 accident expelled 20 million curies of radioactive material, 90% of which settled into the land immediately around the facility. Although some reactors of Mayak were shut down in 1987 and 1990, the facility keeps producing plutonium.\n\n\n== Cultural significance ==\nThe Urals have been viewed by Russians as a \"treasure box\" of mineral resources, which were the basis for its extensive industrial development. In addition to iron and copper the Urals were a source of gold, malachite, alexandrite, and other gems such as those used by the court jeweller Fabergé. As Russians in other regions gather mushrooms or berries, Uralians gather mineral specimens and gems. Dmitry Mamin-Sibiryak (1852–1912) Pavel Bazhov (1879–1950), as well as Aleksey Ivanov and Olga Slavnikova, post-Soviet writers, have written of the region.The region served as a military stronghold during Peter the Great\'s Great Northern War with Sweden, during Stalin\'s rule when the Magnitogorsk Metallurgical Complex was built and Russian industry relocated to the Urals during the Nazi advance at the beginning of World War II, and as the center of the Soviet nuclear industry during the Cold War. Extreme levels of air, water, and radiological contamination and pollution by industrial wastes resulted. Population exodus resulted, and economic depression at the time of the collapse of the Soviet Union, but in post-Soviet times additional mineral exploration, particularly in the northern Urals, has been productive and the region has attracted industrial investment.\n\n\n== See also ==\nYugyd Va National Park\nDyatlov Pass incident\nEast Ural Radioactive Trace\nIdel-Ural State\nPangaea\nResearch Range\nUral Mountains in Nazi planning\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPeakbagger.com page on the Ural Mountains\nUral Expeditions & Tours page on the five parts of the Ural Mountains', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e5/Andradite-23893.jpg');

(51, 'Betty and Barney Hill abduction', 'Barney and Betty Hill were an American couple who claimed they were abducted by extraterrestrials in a rural portion of the state of New Hampshire from September 19 to September 20, 1961. It was the first widely publicized report of an alien abduction in the United States.\nThe incident came to be called the \"Hill Abduction\" and the \"Zeta Reticuli Incident\" because the couple stated they had been kidnapped by aliens who claimed to be from the Zeta Reticuli system. Their story was adapted into the best-selling 1966 book The Interrupted Journey and the 1975 television movie The UFO Incident.  In September 2016, plans were announced to make a film based on the events, with an unknown release date.Most of Betty Hill\'s notes, tapes, and other items have been placed in the permanent collection at the University of New Hampshire, her alma mater. In July 2011, the state Division of Historical Resources marked the site of the alleged craft\'s first approach with a historical marker.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe Hills lived in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. Barney (1922–1969) was employed by the United States Postal Service, while Betty (née Eunice Barrett) (1919–2004) was a social worker. Active in the local Unitarian congregation, the Hills were also members of the NAACP and community leaders, and Barney sat on a local board of the United States Commission on Civil Rights. They were an interracial couple at a time when it was particularly uncommon in the United States; Barney was African American and Betty was white.\n\n\n== UFO encounter ==\nAccording to a variety of reports given by the Hills, the alleged UFO sighting happened on September 19, 1961, around 10:30 p.m. The Hills were driving back to Portsmouth from a vacation in Niagara Falls and Montreal. Just south of Lancaster, New Hampshire, Betty claimed to have observed a bright point of light in the sky that moved from below the moon and the planet Jupiter, upward to the west of the moon. While Barney navigated U.S. Route 3, Betty reasoned that she was observing a falling star, only it moved upward. Since it moved erratically and grew bigger and brighter, Betty urged Barney to stop the car for a closer look, as well as to walk their dog, Delsey. Barney stopped at a scenic picnic area just south of Twin Mountain.Betty, looking through binoculars, observed an \"odd-shaped\" craft flashing multi-colored lights travel across the face of the Moon. Because her sister had several years earlier said she had seen a flying saucer, Betty thought it might be what she was observing. Through binoculars, Barney observed what he reasoned was a commercial airliner traveling toward Vermont on its way to Montreal. However, he soon changed his mind, because without looking as if it had turned, the craft rapidly descended in his direction. This observation caused Barney to realize, \"this object that was a plane was not a plane.\" He quickly returned to the car and drove toward Franconia Notch, a narrow, mountainous stretch of the road.\nThe Hills claimed that they continued driving on the isolated road, moving very slowly through Franconia Notch in order to observe the object as it came even closer. At one point, the object passed above a restaurant and signal tower on top of Cannon Mountain and came out near the Old Man of the Mountain. Betty testified that it was at least one and a half times the length of the granite cliff profile, which was 40 feet (12 m) long, and that it seemed to be rotating. The couple watched as the silent, illuminated craft moved erratically and bounced back and forth in the night sky.Approximately one mile south of Indian Head, they said, the object rapidly descended toward their vehicle, causing Barney to stop in the middle of the highway. The huge, silent craft hovered approximately 80–100 feet (24–30 m) above the Hills\' 1957 Chevrolet Bel Air and filled the entire field of view in the windshield. It reminded Barney of a huge pancake. Carrying his pistol in his pocket, he stepped away from the vehicle and moved closer to the object. Using the binoculars, Barney claimed to have seen about 8 to 11 humanoid figures, who were peering out of the craft\'s windows, seeming to look at him. In unison, all but one figure moved to what appeared to be a panel on the rear wall of the hallway that encircled the front portion of the craft. The one remaining figure continued to look at Barney and communicated a message telling him to \"stay where you are and keep looking.\" Barney had a recollection of observing the humanoid forms wearing glossy black uniforms and black caps. Red lights on what appeared to be bat-wing fins began to telescope out of the sides of the craft, and a long structure descended from the bottom of the craft. The silent craft approached to what Barney estimated was within 50–80 feet (15–24 m) overhead and 300 feet (91 m) away from him. On October 21, 1961, Barney reported to National Investigations Committee On Aerial Phenomena (NICAP) investigator Walter Webb that the \"beings were somehow not human\".Barney \"tore\" the binoculars away from his eyes and ran back to his car. In a near hysterical state, he told Betty, \"They\'re going to capture us!\" He saw the object again shift its location to directly above the vehicle. He drove away at high speed, telling Betty to look for the object. She rolled down the window and looked up. Almost immediately, the Hills heard a rhythmic series of beeping or buzzing sounds, which they said seemed to bounce off the trunk of their vehicle. The car vibrated and a tingling sensation passed through the Hills\' bodies. The Hills said that then they experienced the onset of an altered state of consciousness that left their minds dulled. A second series of beeping or buzzing sounds returned the couple to full consciousness. They found that they had traveled nearly 35 miles (56 km) south, but had only vague, spotty memories of this section of road. They recalled making a sudden, unplanned turn, encountering a roadblock, and observing a fiery orb in the road.\n\n\n== Immediate aftermath ==\nArriving home at about dawn, the Hills assert that they had some odd sensations and impulses they could not readily explain: Betty insisted their luggage be kept near the back door rather than in the main part of the house. Their watches would never run again. Barney said that the leather strap for the binoculars was torn, though he could not recall it tearing. The toes of his best dress shoes were scraped. Barney says he was compelled to examine his genitals in the bathroom, though he found nothing unusual. They took long showers to remove possible contamination and each drew a picture of what they had observed.Perplexed, the Hills say they tried to reconstruct the chronology of events as they witnessed the UFO and drove home. But immediately after they heard the buzzing sounds, their memories became incomplete and fragmented. After sleeping for a few hours, Betty awoke and placed the shoes and clothing she had worn during the drive into her closet, observing that the dress was torn at the hem, zipper and lining. Later, when she retrieved the items from her closet, she noted a pinkish powder on her dress. She hung the dress on her clothesline and the pink powder blew away. But the dress was irreparably damaged. She threw it away, but then changed her mind, retrieving the dress and hanging it in her closet. Over the years, five laboratories have conducted chemical and forensic analyses on the dress.There were shiny, concentric circles on their car\'s trunk that had not been there the previous day. Betty and Barney experimented with a compass, noting that when they moved it close to the spots, the needle would whirl rapidly. But when they moved it a few inches away from the shiny spots, it would drop down.\n\n\n=== Initial report to the U.S. Air Force and NICAP ===\nOn September 21, Betty telephoned Pease Air Force Base to report their UFO encounter, though for fear of being labeled eccentric, she withheld some of the details. On September 22, Major Paul W. Henderson telephoned the Hills for a more detailed interview. Henderson\'s report, dated September 26, determined that the Hills had probably misidentified the planet Jupiter. (This was later changed to \"optical condition\", \"inversion\" and \"insufficient data\".) (Report 100-1-61, Air Intelligence Information Record) His report was forwarded to Project Blue Book, the U.S. Air Force\'s UFO research project.\nWithin days of the encounter, Betty borrowed a UFO book from a local library. It had been written by retired Marine Corps Major Donald E. Keyhoe, who was also the head of NICAP, a civilian UFO research group. On September 26, Betty wrote to Keyhoe. She related the full story, including the details about the humanoid figures that Barney had observed through binoculars. Betty wrote that she and Barney were considering hypnosis to help recall what had happened. Her letter was eventually passed on to Walter N. Webb, a Boston astronomer and NICAP member.\nWebb met with the Hills on October 21, 1961. In a six-hour interview, the Hills related all they could remember of the UFO encounter. Barney asserted that he had developed a sort of \"mental block\" and that he suspected there were some portions of the event that he did not wish to remember. He described in detail all that he could remember about the craft and the appearance of the \"somehow not human\" figures aboard the craft. Webb stated that \"they were telling the truth and the incident probably occurred exactly as reported except for some minor uncertainties and technicalities that must be tolerated in any such observations where human judgment is involved (e.g., exact time and length of visibility, apparent sizes of object and occupants, distance and height of object, etc.).\"\n\n\n== Betty\'s dreams ==\nTen days after the alleged UFO encounter, Betty began having a series of vivid dreams. They continued for five successive nights. Never in her memory had she recalled dreams in such detail and intensity. But they stopped abruptly after five nights and never returned again. They occupied her thoughts during the day. When she finally did mention them to Barney, he was sympathetic, but not too concerned, and the matter was dropped. Betty did not mention them to Barney again.In November 1961, Betty began writing down the details of her dreams. In one dream, she and Barney encountered a roadblock and men who surrounded their car. She lost consciousness, but struggled to regain it. She then realized that she was being forced by two small men to walk in a forest in the nighttime, and of seeing Barney walking behind her, though when she called to him, he seemed to be in a trance or sleepwalking. The men stood about five feet to five feet four inches tall, and wore matching blue uniforms, with caps similar to those worn by military cadets. They appeared nearly human, with black hair, dark eyes, prominent noses and bluish lips. Their skin was a greyish colour.In the dreams, Betty, Barney, and the men walked up a ramp into a disc-shaped craft of metallic appearance. Once inside, Barney and Betty were separated. She protested, and was told by a man she called \"the leader\" that if she and Barney were examined together, it would take much longer to conduct the exams. She and Barney were then taken to separate rooms.\nBetty then dreamt that a new man, similar to the others, entered to conduct her exam with the leader. Betty called this new man \"the examiner\" and said he had a pleasant, calm manner. Though the leader and the examiner spoke to her in English, the examiner\'s command of the language seemed imperfect and she had difficulty understanding him.\nThe examiner told Betty that he would conduct a few tests to note the differences between humans and the craft\'s occupants. He seated her on a chair, and a bright light was shone on her. The man cut off a lock of Betty\'s hair. He examined her eyes, ears, mouth, teeth, throat and hands. He saved trimmings from her fingernails. After examining her legs and feet, the man then used a dull knife, similar to a letter opener, to scrape some of her skin onto what resembled cellophane. He then tested her nervous system and he thrust the needle into her navel, which caused Betty agonizing pain, whereupon the leader waved his hand in front of her eyes and the pain vanished.\nThe examiner left the room and Betty engaged in conversation with the \"leader\". She picked up a book with rows of strange symbols that the \"leader\" said she could take home with her. She also asked from where he came, and he pulled down an instructional map dotted with stars.\nIn Betty\'s dream account, the men began escorting the Hills from the ship when a disagreement broke out. The leader then informed Betty that she couldn\'t keep the book, stating that they had decided that the other men did not want her to even remember the encounter. Betty insisted that no matter what they did to her memory, she would one day recall the events.\nShe and Barney were taken to their car, where the leader suggested that they wait to watch the craft\'s departure. They did so, then resumed their drive.\n\n\n== Medical help and more interviews ==\n\n\n=== Missing time ===\nOn November 25, 1961, the Hills were again interviewed at length by NICAP members, this time C. D. Jackson and Robert E. Hohmann.\nAlthough the Hills had noted that they had arrived home later than anticipated, the drive should have taken about four hours (178 miles). They claimed not to have realized that they arrived home seven hours after their departure from Colebrook. When Hohman and Jackson noted this discrepancy to the Hills, the couple had no explanation (a phenomenon ufologists call \"missing time\"). The Hills claimed to recall almost nothing of the 35 miles of US Route 3 between Lincoln/Indian Head and Ashland. Both claimed to recall an image of a fiery orb sitting on the ground. Betty and Barney reasoned that it must have been the moon, but Hohmann and Jackson informed them that the moon had set earlier in the evening.The subject of hypnosis came up, and it was decided that it should be carried out in order to elicit previously irretrievable memories. Barney was apprehensive about hypnosis, but thought it might help Betty put to rest what Barney described as \"the \'nonsense\' about her dreams.\"By February 1962, the Hills were making frequent weekend drives to the White Mountains, hoping that revisiting the site might spark more memories. They were unsuccessful in trying to locate the site where they observed a fiery orb sitting in the road. However, they were able to eliminate several possible routes. (They found what they claimed was the \"capture\" site on Labor Day weekend in 1965.)\n\n\n=== Private disclosure ===\nOn November 23, 1962, the Hills attended a meeting at the parsonage of their church where the invited guest speaker was Captain Ben H. Swett of the United States Air Force, who had recently published a book of his poetry. After he read selections of his poetry, the pastor asked him to discuss his personal interest in hypnosis. After the meeting broke up, the Hills approached Captain Swett privately and told him what they could remember of their strange encounter. He was particularly interested in the \"missing time\" of the Hills\' account. The Hills asked Swett if he would hypnotize them to recover their memories, but Swett said he was not qualified to do that and cautioned them against going to an amateur hypnotist, such as himself.\n\n\n=== First public disclosure ===\nOn March 3, 1963, the Hills first publicly discussed the UFO encounter with a group at their church.\nOn September 7, 1963, Captain Swett gave a formal lecture on hypnosis to a meeting at the Unitarian Church. After the lecture, the Hills told him that Barney was going to a psychiatrist, a Mr. Stephens, whom he liked and trusted. Captain Swett suggested that Barney ask Stephens about the use of hypnosis in his case.\nWhen Barney next met with Stephens, he asked about hypnosis. Stephens referred the Hills to Benjamin Simon of Boston.\nOn November 3, 1963, the Hills spoke before an amateur UFO study group, the Two State UFO Study Group, in Quincy Center, Massachusetts.\nThe Hills first met Simon on December 14, 1963. Early in their discussions, Simon determined that the UFO encounter was causing Barney far more worry and anxiety than he was willing to admit. Though Simon dismissed the popular extraterrestrial hypothesis as impossible, it seemed obvious to him that the Hills genuinely thought they had witnessed a UFO with human-like occupants. Simon hoped to uncover more about the experience through hypnosis.\n\n\n== Simon\'s hypnosis sessions ==\nSimon began hypnotizing the Hills on January 4, 1964. He hypnotized Betty and Barney several times each, and the sessions lasted until June 6, 1964. Simon conducted the sessions on Barney and Betty separately, so they could not overhear one another\'s recollections. At the end of each session he reinstated amnesia.\n\n\n=== Barney\'s sessions ===\nSimon hypnotized Barney first. His recall of witnessing non-human figures was quite emotional, punctuated with expressions of fear, emotional outbursts and incredulity. Barney said that, due to his fear, he kept his eyes closed for much of the abduction and physical examination. Based on these early responses, Simon told Barney that he would not remember the hypnosis sessions until he was certain he could remember them without being further traumatized.\nUnder hypnosis (as was consistent with his conscious recall), Barney reported that the binocular strap had broken when he ran from the UFO back to his car. He recalled driving the car away from the UFO, but that afterwards he felt irresistibly compelled to pull off the road and drive into the woods. He eventually sighted six men standing in the dirt road. The car stalled and three of the men approached the car. They told Barney to not fear them. He was still anxious, however, and he reported that the leader told Barney to close his eyes. While hypnotized, Barney said, \"I felt like the eyes had pushed into my eyes.\"Barney described the beings as generally similar to Betty\'s hypnotic (not dream) recollection. The beings often stared into his eyes, said Barney, with a terrifying, mesmerizing effect. Under hypnosis, Barney said things like, \"Oh, those eyes. They\'re there in my brain\" (from his first hypnosis session) and \"I was told to close my eyes because I saw two eyes coming close to mine, and I felt like the eyes had pushed into my eyes\" (from his second hypnosis session) and \"All I see are these eyes... I\'m not even afraid that they\'re not connected to a body. They\'re just there. They\'re just up close to me, pressing against my eyes.\"Barney related that he and Betty were taken onto the disc-shaped craft, where they were separated. He was escorted to a room by three of the men and told to lie on a small rectangular exam table. Unlike Betty, Barney\'s narrative of the exam was less detailed, as he continued to keep his eyes closed for most of the exam. A cup-like device was placed over his genitals. He did not experience an orgasm, though Barney thought that a sperm sample had been taken. The men scraped his skin and peered in his ears and mouth. A thin tube or cylinder was inserted into his anus and quickly removed. Someone felt his spine and seemed to be counting his vertebrae.\nBetty reported a conversation with the \"leader\" that she understood in English. Barney said that he heard them speaking in a mumbling language he did not understand, yet he also understood them in English. Betty also mentioned this detail. The few times they communicated with him, Barney said it seemed to be \"thought transference\"; at that time, he was unfamiliar with the word \"telepathy\". Both Betty and Barney stated that they hadn\'t observed the beings\' mouths moving when they communicated in English with them.\nHe recalled being escorted from the ship and taken to his car. In a daze, he watched the ship leave. Barney remembered a light appearing on the road, and he said, \"Oh no, not again.\" He recalled Betty\'s speculation that the light might have been the moon, though the moon had in fact set several hours earlier. He also stated that he attempted to produce the code-like buzzing sounds which seemed to strike the car\'s trunk a second time by driving from side to side and stopping and starting the vehicle. His attempt was unsuccessful.\n\n\n=== Betty\'s sessions ===\nUnder hypnosis, Betty\'s account was similar to the events of her five dreams about the UFO abduction, but there were also notable differences, mainly pertaining to her capture and release. The technology on the craft was different. The short men had a significantly different physical appearance from that of her dreams. The sequential order of the abduction event was also different from Betty\'s dream account.  Barney\'s and Betty\'s memories in hypnotic regression were consistent with one another but contradicted some of the information in Betty\'s dreams.Betty exhibited considerable emotional distress during her capture and examination. Simon ended one session early because tears were flowing down her cheeks and she appeared distressed.\nSimon gave Betty the post-hypnotic suggestion that she could sketch a copy of the \"star map\" that she later described as a three-dimensional projection similar to a hologram. Eventually, she did what Simon suggested.  Although she said the map had many stars, she drew only those that stood out in her memory. Her map consisted of twelve prominent stars connected by lines and three lesser ones that formed a distinctive triangle (see below). She said she was told the stars connected by solid lines formed \"trade routes\", whereas dashed lines were to less-traveled stars.\n\n\n=== Simon\'s conclusions ===\nAfter the hypnosis sessions, Simon speculated that Barney\'s recollection of the UFO encounter was possibly a fantasy inspired by Betty\'s dreams. Simon thought it was the most reasonable and consistent explanation. Barney rejected this idea, noting that while their memories were consistent in some regards, there were also portions of both their narratives that were unique to each. Barney was now ready to accept that they had been abducted by the occupants of a UFO, though he never embraced it as fully as Betty did.\nThough the Hills and Simon disagreed about the nature of the case, they all concurred that the hypnosis sessions were effective: the Hills were no longer tormented by anxiety about their experience.\nAfterwards, Simon wrote an article about the Hills for the journal Psychiatric Opinion, explaining his conclusions that the case was a singular psychological aberration.\n\n\n== Publicity after the hypnosis sessions ==\nThe Hills went back to their regular lives. They were willing to discuss the alleged UFO encounter with friends, family and the occasional UFO researcher, but the Hills apparently made no effort to seek publicity.\nOn October 25, 1965, a front page story in the Boston Traveller asked \"UFO Chiller: Did THEY Seize Couple?\" Reporter John H. Luttrell of the Traveler had allegedly been given an audio tape recording of the lecture the Hills had made in Quincy Center in late 1963. Luttrell learned that the Hills had undergone hypnosis with Simon; he also obtained notes from confidential interviews the Hills had given to UFO investigators. On October 26, United Press International (UPI) picked up Luttrell\'s story, and the Hills earned international attention.\nIn 1966, writer John G. Fuller secured the cooperation of the Hills and Simon and wrote the book The Interrupted Journey (see below) about the case. The book included a copy of Betty\'s sketch of the \"star map\". The book was a quick success, and went through several printings.Later in life, Betty claimed to have seen UFOs a number of times after the initial abduction, and she \"became a celebrity in the UFO community.\"Barney died of a cerebral hemorrhage on February 25, 1969, at age 46; Betty Hill died of cancer on October 17, 2004, at age 85, never having remarried.\n\n\n== Analyzing the star map ==\n\nIn 1968, Marjorie Fish of Oak Harbor, Ohio, read Fuller\'s Interrupted Journey. She was an elementary school teacher and amateur astronomer. Intrigued by the \"star map\", Fish wondered if it might be \"deciphered\" to determine which star system the UFO came from. Assuming that one of the fifteen stars on the map must represent the Earth\'s Sun, Fish constructed a three-dimensional model of nearby Sun-like stars using thread and beads, basing stellar distances on those published in the 1969 Gliese Star Catalogue. Studying thousands of vantage points over several years, the only one that seemed to match the Hill map was from the viewpoint of the double star system of Zeta Reticuli.\nFish sent her analysis to Webb. Agreeing with her conclusions, Webb sent the map to Terence Dickinson, editor of the popular magazine Astronomy. Dickinson did not endorse Fish and Webb\'s conclusions, but for the first time in the journal\'s history, Astronomy invited comments and debate on a UFO report, starting with an opening article in the December 1974 issue. For about a year afterward, the opinions page of Astronomy carried arguments for and against Fish\'s star map. Notable was an argument made by Carl Sagan and Steven Soter, arguing that the seeming \"star map\" was little more than a random alignment of chance points. In an episode of Cosmos in 1980, Sagan demonstrated that without the lines drawn in the maps, the Hill map bore no resemblance to the real-life map. In contrast, those more favorable to the map, such as David Saunders, a statistician who had been on the Condon UFO study, argued that unusual alignment of key Sun-like stars in a plane centered around Zeta Reticuli (first described by Fish) was statistically improbable to have happened by chance from a random group of stars in our immediate neighborhood.\n\n\n== Interrupted Journey ==\nThe 1966 publication of Interrupted Journey, by John G. Fuller, details much of the Hills\' claims. Excerpts of the book were published in Look magazine, and Interrupted Journey went on to sell many copies and greatly publicize the Hills\' account. Betty\'s niece Kathleen Marden explored Fuller\'s themes along with scientist Stanton T. Friedman in her book Captured! The Betty and Barney Hill UFO Experience. Marden knew Betty well and had spoken with her at great length about the encounter. She also examined all of the historical records and scientific reports pertaining to the case and transcribed the Hills\' hypnosis sessions with Benjamin Simon for her detailed comparative analysis.\n\n\n== Refutations ==\nPsychiatrists later suggested that the supposed abduction was a hallucination brought on by the stress of being an interracial couple in early 1960s United States. Betty discounted this suggestion, noting her relationship with Barney was happy, and their interracial marriage caused no notable problems with their friends or family. As noted in The Interrupted Journey, Simon thought that the Hills\' marital status had nothing to do with the UFO encounter.\nSkeptic blogger Brian Dunning noted that the hypnosis sessions occurred over two years after the reported abductions, which afforded the couple plenty of time to discuss their encounter.  Dunning concluded that the Hills\' \"inventive tale from the mind of a lifelong UFO fanatic ... is unsupported by any useful evidence, and is perfectly consistent with the purely natural explanation.\" He added that a timeline analysis of the two Air Force radar sightings from that night in the Project Blue Book record shows that neither correlated with the Hills\' story. The Air Force concluded that both targets were probably weather balloons.\n\nIn his 1990 article \"Entirely Unpredisposed\", Martin Kottmeyer suggested that Barney\'s memories revealed under hypnosis might have been influenced by an episode of the science fiction television show The Outer Limits, titled \"The Bellero Shield\", which was broadcast about two weeks before Barney\'s first hypnotic session. The episode featured an extraterrestrial with large eyes who says, \"In all the universes, in all the unities beyond the universes, all who have eyes have eyes that speak.\" The report from the regression featured a scenario that was in some respects similar to the television show. In part, Kottmeyer wrote:\nWraparound eyes are an extreme rarity in science fiction films. I know of only one instance. They appeared on the alien of an episode of an old TV series The Outer Limits entitled \"The Bellero Shield\". A person familiar with Barney\'s sketch in \"The Interrupted Journey\" and the sketch done in collaboration with the artist David Baker will find a \"frisson\" of \"déjà vu\" creeping up his spine when seeing this episode. The resemblance is much abetted by an absence of ears, hair, and nose on both aliens. Could it be by chance? Consider this: Barney first described and drew the wraparound eyes during the hypnosis session dated 22 February 1964. \"The Bellero Shield\" was first broadcast on 10 February 1964. Only twelve days separate the two instances. If the identification is admitted, the commonness of wraparound eyes in the abduction literature falls to cultural forces.\nWhen a different researcher asked Betty about The Outer Limits, she insisted she had \"never heard of it\". Kottmeyer also pointed out that some motifs in the Hills\' account were present in the 1953 film, Invaders from Mars. A careful analysis of Barney\'s description of the non-human entities that he observed reveals significant similarities between the \"Bifrost Man\" and Barney\'s descriptive details. One must also take into account Barney\'s conscious, continuous recall of the entities he observed on the hovering craft. They were dressed in black, shiny uniforms and were \"somehow not human\".\nJim Macdonald, a resident of the area in which the Hills claimed to have been abducted, has produced a detailed analysis of their journey which concludes that the episode was provoked by their misperceiving an aircraft warning beacon on Cannon Mountain as a UFO. Macdonald notes that from the road the Hills took, the beacon appears and disappears at exactly the same time the Hills describe the UFO as appearing and disappearing. The remainder of the experience is ascribed to stress, sleep deprivation, and false memories \"recovered\" under hypnosis. UFO expert Robert Sheaffer writes after reading Macdonald\'s recreation that the Hills are the \"poster children\" for not driving when sleep deprived. Macdonald\'s article focuses primarily on the Hills\' observations of the light in the sky and the timing of the journey, discounting the Hills\' accounts of close encounters south of Cannon Mountain as recovered memories.\nSkeptical Inquirer columnist Robert Shaeffer wrote the following:\n\nI was present at the National UFO Conference in New York City in 1980, at which Betty presented some of the UFO photos she had taken. She showed what must have been well over two hundred slides, mostly of blips, blurs, and blobs against a dark background. These were supposed to be UFOs coming in close, chasing her car, landing, etc... After her talk had exceeded about twice its allotted time, Betty was literally jeered off the stage by what had been at first a very sympathetic audience. This incident, witnessed by many of UFOlogy\'s leaders and top activists, removed any lingering doubts about Betty\'s credibility—she had none. In 1995, Betty Hill wrote a self-published book, A Common Sense Approach to UFOs. It is filled with obviously delusional stories, such as seeing entire squadrons of UFOs in flight and a truck levitating above the freeway.\nSheaffer later wrote that as late as 1977, Betty Hill would go on UFO vigils at least three times a week. During one evening she was joined by UFO enthusiast John Oswald. When asked about Betty\'s continuing UFO observations, Oswald stated, \"She is not really seeing UFOs, but she is calling them that.\" On the night they went out together, \"Mrs. Hill was unable to distinguish between a landed UFO and a streetlight\". In a later interview, Sheaffer recounts that Betty Hill writes \"UFOs are a new science ... and our science cannot explain them\".Robert Sheaffer released 48 pages of archived documents relating to Betty and Barney Hill, Benjamin Simon and Philip J. Klass on the Internet on December 23, 2015.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nBarney Hill was on an episode of To Tell the Truth, episode airdate December 12, 1966.\nThe couple was portrayed by James Earl Jones and Estelle Parsons in the 1975 television film adapted by S. Lee Pogostin, The UFO Incident, and by Basil Wallace and Lee Garlington in the 1996 television series Dark Skies.\nThe encounter was portrayed in a segment on the 12th episode of Carl Sagan\'s miniseries Cosmos, \"Encyclopedia Galactica\".\nDetails of the Hills\' case were used in The X-Files episode \"Jose Chung\'s From Outer Space\".\nThe graphic novel Saucer Country (2012) by Paul Cornell includes the Hills\' experience.\nAn episode of the Travel Channel series Mysteries at the Museum covered the subject of the abduction.\nIn the second season of American Horror Story, called Asylum, Evan Peters and Britne Oldford portray interracial couple Kit and Alma Walker who were abducted by aliens and most likely based on the Hills.\nIn the Gravity Falls episode \"Dipper and Mabel vs. The Future\" there is a cryptogram on a UFO that reads \"Betty and Barney were here\".\nIn September 2017, on the People of Earth episode titled \"Alien Experiencer Expo\", a poster of the Hills is presented at the exposition, with the title \"Betty & Barney Hill, First Couple of the Cosmos\".\nIn May 2018, the Culture and Myth Podcast series \"Lore\" covered the event in \"Episode 87: Road Trip\".\nIn 2018, the story forms the basis of the \"Dinner Party\" virtual reality exhibit at the travelling art show Wonderspaces.\nThe podcast \"And That\'s Why We Drink\" covered the Hills\' story in their January 7, 2018 episode, \"Bananas in Pajamas and Your Friendly Local Kioskman.\"\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of reported UFO sightings\nSerpo\nZeta Reticuli in fiction\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Book sources ==\nClark, Jerome.

(52, 'Rendlesham Forest incident', 'In late December 1980,  there was a series of reported sightings of unexplained lights near Rendlesham Forest, Suffolk, England, which have become linked with claims of UFO landings. The events occurred just outside RAF Woodbridge, which was used at the time by the United States Air Force (USAF). USAF personnel, including deputy base commander Lieutenant Colonel Charles I. Halt, claimed to see things they described as a UFO sighting.\nThe occurrence is the most famous of claimed UFO events to have happened in the United Kingdom, ranking among the best-known reported UFO events worldwide. It has been compared to the Roswell UFO incident in the United States and is sometimes referred to as \"Britain\'s Roswell\".The UK Ministry of Defence stated the event posed no threat to national security, and it therefore never was investigated as a security matter. Sceptics have explained the sightings as a misinterpretation of a series of nocturnal lights: a fireball, the Orfordness Lighthouse and bright stars.\n\n\n== Main events ==\n\n\n=== 26 December ===\nAround 3:00 a.m. on 26 December 1980 (reported as the 27th by Halt in his memo to the UK Ministry of Defence – see below) a security patrol near the east gate of RAF Woodbridge saw lights apparently descending into nearby Rendlesham Forest. These lights have been attributed by astronomers to a piece of natural debris seen burning up as a fireball over southern England at that time. Servicemen initially thought it was a downed aircraft but, upon entering the forest to investigate they saw, according to Halt\'s memo, what they described as a glowing object, metallic in appearance, with coloured lights. As they attempted to approach the object, it appeared to move through the trees, and \"the animals on a nearby farm went into a frenzy\". One of the servicemen, Sergeant Jim Penniston, later claimed to have encountered a \"craft of unknown origin\" while in the forest, although there was no publicised mention of this at the time and there is no corroboration from other witnesses.Shortly after 4:00 a.m. local police were called to the scene but reported that the only lights they could see were those from the Orford Ness lighthouse, some miles away on the coast.After daybreak on the morning of 26 December, servicemen returned to a small clearing near the eastern edge of the forest and found three small impressions on the ground in a triangular pattern, as well as burn marks and broken branches on nearby trees. At 10:30 a.m. the local police were called out again, this time to see the impressions, which they thought could have been made by an animal. Georgina Bruni, in her book You Can\'t Tell the People, published a photograph of the supposed landing site taken on the morning after the first sighting.\n\n\n=== 28 December ===\nThe deputy base commander, Lieutenant Colonel Charles Halt, visited the site with several servicemen in the early hours of 28 December 1980 (reported as the 29th by Halt). They took radiation readings in the triangle of depressions and in the surrounding area using an AN/PDR-27, a standard U.S. military radiation survey meter. Although they recorded 0.07 milliroentgens per hour, in other regions they detected 0.03 to 0.04 milliroentgens per hour, around the background level. Furthermore, they detected a similar small \'burst\' over half a mile away from the landing site. Halt recorded the events on a micro-cassette recorder (see § The Halt Tape, below).\nIt was during this investigation that a flashing light was seen across the field to the east, almost in line with a farmhouse, as the witnesses had seen on the first night. The Orford Ness lighthouse is visible further to the east in the same line of sight (see below).Later, according to Halt\'s memo, three star-like lights were seen in the sky, two to the north and one to the south, about 10 degrees above the horizon. Halt said that the brightest of these hovered for two to three hours and seemed to beam down a stream of light from time to time. Astronomers have explained these star-like lights as bright stars.\n\n\n== Location ==\nRendlesham Forest is owned by the Forestry Commission and consists of about 5.8 square miles (15 km2) of coniferous plantations, interspersed with broadleaved belts, heathland and wetland areas. It is located in the county of Suffolk, about 8 miles (13 km) east of the town of Ipswich.\n\nThe incident occurred in the vicinity of two former military bases: RAF Bentwaters, which is just to the north of the forest, and RAF Woodbridge which extends into the forest from the west and is bounded by the forest on its northern and eastern edges. At the time, both were being used by the United States Air Force and were under the command of wing commander Colonel Gordon E. Williams. The base commander was Colonel Ted Conrad, and his deputy was Lieutenant Colonel Charles I. Halt.\nThe main events of the incident, including the supposed landing or landings, took place in the forest, which starts at the east end of the base runway or about 0.3 miles (0.5 km) to the east of the East Gate of RAF Woodbridge, from where security guards first noticed mysterious lights appearing to descend into the forest. The forest extends east about one mile (1.6 km) beyond East Gate, ending at a farmer\'s field at Capel Green, where additional events allegedly took place.\nOrfordness Lighthouse, which sceptics identify as the flashing light seen off to the coast by the airmen, is along the same line of sight about 5 miles (8.0 km) further east of the forest\'s edge. At that time it was one of the brightest lighthouses in the UK.\n\n\n== Primary and secondary sources ==\n\n\n=== The Halt memo ===\n\nThe first piece of primary evidence to be made available to the public was a memorandum written by the deputy base commander, Lieutenant Colonel Charles I. Halt, to the Ministry of Defence (MoD). Known as the \"Halt memo\", this was made publicly available in the United States under the U.S. Freedom of Information Act in 1983. The memorandum, was dated \"13 Jan 1981\" under the title \"Unexplained Lights\". The two-week delay between the incident and the report might account for errors in the dates and times given. The memo was not classified in any way.Dr. David Clarke, a consultant to the National Archives, has investigated the background of this memo and the reaction to it at the MoD. His interviews with the personnel involved confirmed the cursory nature of the investigation made by the MoD, and failed to find any evidence for any other reports on the incident made by the USAF or UK apart from the Halt memo. Halt has since gone on record as saying he believes that he witnessed an extraterrestrial event that was then covered up.\n\n\n=== The Halt Tape ===\n \nIn 1984, a copy of what became known as the \"Halt Tape\" was released to UFO researchers by Colonel Sam Morgan, who had by then succeeded Ted Conrad as Halt\'s superior. This tape chronicles Halt\'s investigation in the forest in real time, including taking radiation readings, the sighting of the flashing light between trees, and the starlike objects that hovered and twinkled. The tape has been transcribed by researcher Ian Ridpath, who includes a link to an audio download and also a step-by-step analysis of the entire contents of the tape.\n\n\n=== Statements from eyewitnesses on 26 December ===\nIn 1997, Scottish researcher James Easton obtained the original witness statements made by those involved in the first night’s sightings. One of the witnesses, Ed Cabansag, said in his statement: \"We figured the lights were coming from past the forest since nothing was visible when we passed through the woody forest. We would see a glowing near the beacon light, but as we got closer we found it to be a lit-up farmhouse. We got to a vantage point where we could determine that what we were chasing was only a beacon light off in the distance.\" Another participant, John Burroughs, also stated: \"We could see a beacon going around so we went towards it. We followed it for about two miles [3 km] before we could [see] it was coming from a lighthouse.\"\nBurroughs reported a noise \"like a woman was screaming\" and also that \"you could hear the farm animals making a lot of noises.\" Halt heard the same noises two nights later. Such noise could have been made by Muntjac deer in the forest, which are known for their loud, shrill bark when alarmed.\n\n\n=== The Halt affidavit ===\nIn June 2010, retired Colonel Charles Halt signed a notarised affidavit, in which he again summarised what had happened, then stated he believed the event to be extraterrestrial and it had been covered up by both the UK and US. Contradictions between this affidavit and the facts as recorded at the time in Halt\'s memo and tape recording have been pointed out.In 2010, base commander Colonel Ted Conrad provided a statement about the incident to Clarke. Conrad stated that \"We saw nothing that resembled Lieutenant Colonel Halt\'s descriptions either in the sky or on the ground\" and that \"We had people in position to validate Halt\'s narrative, but none of them could.\" In an interview, Conrad criticised Halt for the claims in his affidavit, saying \"he should be ashamed and embarrassed by his allegation that his country and Britain both conspired to deceive their citizens over this issue. He knows better.\" Conrad also disputed the testimony of Sergeant Jim Penniston, who claimed to have touched an alien spacecraft; he said that he interviewed Penniston at the time and he had not mentioned any such occurrence. Conrad also suggested that the entire incident might have been a hoax.A 1983 Omni article says \"Colonel Ted Conrad the base commander... recalls five Air Force policemen spotted lights from what they thought was a small plane descending into the forest. Two of the men tracked the object on foot and came upon a large tripod-mounted craft. It had no windows but was studded with brilliant red and blue lights. Each time the men came within 50 yards of the ship, Conrad relates, it levitated six feet in the air and backed away. They followed it for almost an hour through the woods and across a field until it took off at \'phenomenal speed.\' Acting on the reports made by his men, Colonel Conrad began a brief investigation of the incident in the morning. He went into the forest and located a triangular pattern ostensibly made by the tripod legs.  ...he did interview two of the eyewitnesses and concludes, \'Those lads saw something, but I don\'t know what it was\'.\"\n\n\n=== Suffolk police log ===\nSuffolk police were called to the scene on the night of the initial sighting and again the following morning but found nothing unusual. On the night of the initial incident they reported that the only lights visible were from the Orford lighthouse. They attributed the indentations in the ground to animals. The Suffolk constabulary file on the case was released in 2005 under the UK’s Freedom of Information Act and can be accessed on their website. It includes a letter dated 28 July 1999 written by Inspector Mike Topliss who notes that one of the police constables who attended the scene on the first night returned to the site in daylight in case he had missed something. \"There was nothing to be seen and he remains unconvinced that the occurrence was genuine,\" wrote Topliss. \"The immediate area was swept by powerful light beams from a landing beacon at RAF Bentwaters and the Orfordness lighthouse. I know from personal experience that at night, in certain weather and cloud conditions, these beams were very pronounced and certainly caused strange visual effects.\"\n\n\n=== Ministry of Defence file ===\nEvidence of a substantial MoD file on the subject led to claims of a cover-up; some interpreted this as part of a larger pattern of information suppression concerning the true nature of unidentified flying objects, by both the United States and British governments. However, when the file was released in 2001 it turned out to consist mostly of internal correspondence and responses to inquiries from the public. The lack of any in-depth investigation in the publicly released documents is consistent with the MoD\'s earlier statement that they never took the case seriously. Included in the released files is an explanation given by defence minister Lord Trefgarne as to why the MoD did not investigate further.\n\n\n== Sceptical analysis ==\n\nOne proposed theory is that the incident was a hoax. The BBC reported that a former U.S. security policeman, Kevin Conde, claimed responsibility for creating strange lights in the forest by driving around in a police vehicle whose lights he had modified. However, there is no evidence that this prank took place on the nights in question.Other explanations for the incident have included a downed Soviet spy satellite, but no evidence has been produced to support this.The most widely accepted explanation is that the sightings were due to a combination of three main factors. The initial sighting at 3 am on 26 December, when the airmen saw something apparently descending into the forest, coincided with the appearance of a bright fireball over southern England, and such fireballs are a common source of UFO reports. The supposed landing marks were identified by police and foresters as rabbit diggings. No evidence has emerged to confirm that anything actually came down in the forest.\nAccording to the witness statements from 26 December the flashing light seen from the forest lay in the same direction as the Orfordness Lighthouse. When the eyewitnesses attempted to approach the light they realised it was further off than they thought. One of the witnesses, Ed Cabansag, described it as “a beacon light off in the distance” while another, John Burroughs, said it was “a lighthouse” (see Statements from eyewitnesses on 26 December, above).\nTimings on Halt’s tape recording during his sighting on 28 December indicate that the light he saw, which lay in the same direction as the light seen two nights earlier, flashed every five seconds, which was the flash rate of the Orfordness Lighthouse.The star-like objects that Halt reported hovering low to the north and south are thought by some sceptics to have been misinterpretations of bright stars distorted by atmospheric and optical effects, another common source of UFO reports. The brightest of them, to the south, matched the position of Sirius, the brightest star in the night sky.In his 6 January 2009 Skeptoid podcast episode titled \"The Rendlesham Forest UFO,\" scientific sceptic author Brian Dunning evaluated the original eye-witness reports and audio recordings, as well as the resulting media reporting of this incident. After a lengthy analysis Dunning concluded:\n\nCol. Halt\'s thoroughness was commendable, but even he can be mistaken. Without exception, everything he reported on his audiotape and in his written memo has a perfectly rational and unremarkable explanation... All that remains is the tale that the men were debriefed and ordered never to mention the event, and warned that \"bullets are cheap\". Well, as we\'ve seen on television, the men all talk quite freely about it, and even Col. Halt says that to this day nobody has ever debriefed him. So this appears to be just another dramatic invention for television, perhaps from one of the men who have expanded their stories over the years.\nWhen you examine each piece of evidence separately on its own merit, you avoid the trap of pattern matching and finding correlations where none exist. The meteors had nothing to do with the lighthouse or the rabbit diggings, but when you hear all three stories told together, it\'s easy to conclude (as did the airmen) that the light overhead became an alien spacecraft in the forest. Always remember: Separate pieces of poor evidence don\'t aggregate together into a single piece of good evidence. You can stack cowpies as high as you want, but they won\'t turn into a bar of gold.\n\n\n== UFO Trail ==\n\nIn 2005, the Forestry Commission used Lottery proceeds to create  a trail in Rendlesham Forest because of public interest and nicknamed it the UFO Trail. In 2014, the Forestry Service commissioned an artist to create a work which has been installed at the end of the trail. The artist states the piece is modelled on sketches that purportedly represent some versions of the UFO claimed to have been seen at Rendlesham.\n\n\n== Change of heart ==\nIn 2010, Jenny Randles, who first reported the case in the London Evening Standard in 1981 and co-authored with the local researchers who uncovered the events, the first book on the case in 1984 - Sky Crash: A Cosmic Conspiracy, emphasised her previously expressed doubts that the incident was caused by extraterrestrial visitors. Whilst suggesting that a UAP, an unidentified atmospheric phenomenon of unknown origin, might have caused parts of the case, she noted: \"Whilst some puzzles remain, we can probably say that no unearthly craft were seen in Rendlesham Forest. We can also argue with confidence that the main focus of the events was a series of misperceptions of everyday things encountered in less than everyday circumstances.\"\n\n\n== Possible prank ==\nIn December 2018 Dr David Clarke, a British UFO researcher, reported a claim that the incident was a set-up by the SAS as a revenge plot on the USAF. According to this story, in August 1980, the SAS parachuted into RAF Woodbridge to test the security at the nuclear site. The USAF had recently upgraded their radar and detected the black parachutes of the SAS men as they descended to the base. The SAS troops were interrogated and beaten up, with the ultimate insult that they were called \"unidentified aliens\". To enact their revenge, the SAS \"gave\" the USAF their own version of an alien event; \n\nFor his article, Dr Clarke interviewed an SAS sniper active at the time of the incident, and the US Base Commander at the time of the incident, Colonel Ted Conrad, both of whom regard this \'prank\' claim as highly implausible because of security considerations.\n\n\n== See also ==\nLakenheath-Bentwaters incident\nUFO conspiracy theory\nUnidentified flying object\nPaulding Light\nList of reported UFO sightings\nUFO sightings in United Kingdom\nThe Rendlesham UFO Incident, a 2014 film based on these events\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nForestry.gov.uk\n2005 Nick Pope Interview at 28:25 minutes and 32:15 minutes he talks about Rendlesham.\nDunning, Brian (6 January 2009). \"Skeptoid #135: The Rendlesham Forest UFO\".

(53, '2009 Norwegian spiral anomaly', 'The Norwegian spiral anomaly of 2009 appeared in the night sky over Norway. It was visible from, and photographed from, northern Norway and Sweden. The spiral consisted of a blue beam of light with a greyish spiral emanating from one end of it. The light could be seen in all of Trøndelag to the south (the two red counties on the map to the right) and all across the three northern counties which compose Northern Norway, as well as from Northern Sweden and it lasted for 10 minutes. According to sources, it looked like a blue light coming from behind a mountain, stopping in mid-air, and starting to spiral outwards.  A similar, though less spectacular event had also occurred in Norway the month before. Both events had visual features of failed flights of Russian SLBM RSM-56 Bulava missiles, and the Russian Defense Ministry said shortly after that such an event had taken place on 9 December.\n\n\n== Initial speculations ==\nHundreds of calls flooded the Norwegian Meteorological Institute as residents wanted to know what they were seeing. Norwegian celebrity astronomer Knut Jørgen Røed Ødegaard commented that he first speculated that it was a fireball meteor, but rejected that possibility because the light lasted too long. He also pointed out the area over which the light had been observed was exceptionally large, covering all of Northern Norway and Trøndelag.  It was also suggested that it could have been a rare, never-before-seen Northern Lights variant.UFO enthusiasts immediately began speculating whether the aerial light display could be evidence of extraterrestrial intelligence proposing among other things that it could be a wormhole opening up, or somehow was linked to the recent high-energy experiments undertaken at the Large Hadron Collider in Switzerland.\n\n\n== Official Russian explanation ==\nOn 10 December 2009, the Russian Ministry of Defence suggested an explanation, stating that a Bulava missile test had failed. According to a spokesman, \"The missile\'s first two stages worked as normal, but there was a technical malfunction at the next third stage of the trajectory.\" Russian defence analyst Pavel Felgenhauer stated to AFP that \"such lights and clouds appear from time to time when a missile fails in the upper layers of the atmosphere and have been reported before ... At least this failed test made some nice fireworks for the Norwegians.\" Prior to the Russian statement, Jonathan McDowell, an astrophysicist at the Harvard–Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, had already suggested that the unusual light display occurred when the missile\'s third stage nozzle was damaged, causing the exhaust to come out sideways and sending the missile into a spin.\n\n\n== See also ==\nGhost rockets\nHessdalen light\nList of UFO sightings\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPost on Russian site of official warning of a rocket test, prohibiting navigation in the area until 15 Dec.\nAtkinson, Nancy (9 December 2009). \"What was the Norway Spiral?\".

Suddenly, they heard an extremely sharp sound. Some moments later, they saw a lens-shaped object landing near them. The workmen run away leaving Higgins alone. The man reported that three humanoid figures emerged from the UFO and spoke to him in an unknown language; after about a half-hour, they returned to the UFO which then took them away.\n\n\n== 1952 ==\nOn 5 May 1952, the journalist Joao Martins and the photographer Eduardo Keffel claimed to have seen a flying disk in the vicinity of Barra da Tijuca. Keffel took some photographs of the UFO, which were published by the magazine O Cruzeiro.\n\n\n== 1957 ==\nOn 13 September 1957 The journalist Ibrahim Sued received an envelope containing a letter and three fragments of metal. The author of the letter wrote that he saw a UFO which exploded in the sky over the beach of Ubatuba; he collected some fragments and sent three of these to the journal together with the letter. Sued sent the fragments to a laboratory which analyzed them and discovered that they consisted of pure magnesium. James Harder and other ufologists came to the conclusion that the fragments of Ubatuba have an extraterrestrial origin, but other investigators think that this story is a hoax.\nAntonio Villas Boas claimed to have been abducted by extraterrestrials on 16 October 1957.  Though similar stories had circulated for years beforehand, Boas\'s claims was among the first alien abduction stories to receive wide attention.\nOn the evening of November 4, 1957, two sentinels at the Itaipu Fort, (Praia Grande, São Paulo) suffered moderate burns after being hit by a heat wave from an unidentified  flying object, which allegedly came descending from the sky. The entire electricity of the fort, including the emergency circuits, went down during the incident. Afterwards, Brazilian Army and United States Air Force (USAF) personnel, along with investigators of the Brazilian Air Force, flew to the fort to interview the soldiers. USAF\'s Donald Keyhoe expressed his opinions on the case:\"Such civilization could see that in Earth we now have atomic bombs and that we are quickly improving our rockets. Given the past history of mankind - frequent wars showing a belligerent human race - they must have become alarmated. We should, therefore, expect, specially at this times, to receive such visits. According to this, the main objective of the aliens would be to watch our space improvements, fearing we could become a threat to other planets. If this hypothesis is exact, it could be expanded to link the launching of the Sputniks with the attack to the Fort Itaipu. However, this sounded absurd for all investigators. It would mean that the aliens would be worried about our firsts steps in space, and by small space ships so primitive that would look like a canoe if compared to a transatlantic liner. It would also mean  that those burnings had the purpose of demonstrate the superior weapons they could use against the aggressive explorers coming from the Earth. However, we were still far from the piloted space flight, even to the Moon. According to the human logic, we would not be able to threaten a superior space ship - not now nor later.\"\n\nIn 2008, a document reporting the incident was written at the Brazilian Embassy in the United States.\n\n\n== 1958 ==\n\nAt 12:00 pm of 16 January 1958, the Brazilian ship Almirante Saldanha, taking part in projects of the Ano Geofísico Internacional, was preparing to sail away from Ilha de Trindade, off the coast of Espírito Santo.  Captain Viegas was on the deck with several scientists and members of the crew when he suddenly noticed a flying object, which had a “ring” around it, just like Saturn. Everyone reportedly saw the UFO at the same time.  It came to the island from the east, flew towards the Pico Desejado (Wished Peak), made a step turn and went away very quickly to the northwest.  As soon as the object was noticed Almiro Baraúna was requested for photographing. After getting the camera and going up the quarter-deck, he stated that he managed to take pictures of the object.\n\n\n== 1966 ==\n\nTwo men were found dead near Niterói. Both were wearing lead masks. A UFO allegedly was seen flying near the point where both died.\n\n\n== 1977 ==\nThe Colares flap refers to an outbreak of UFO sightings that occurred in 1977 on the Brazilian island of Colares. During the outbreak, the UFOs allegedly attacked the citizens with intense beams of radiation that left burn marks and puncture wounds. These sightings led to the Brazilian government dispatching a team to investigate under the codename Operation Saucer (Portuguese: Prato, see below), but the government later recalled the team and classified the files until the late 1990s.\nThe first operation of the Brazilian Air Force created only to investigate UFO-related issues. This operation was started shortly after the Colares UFO flap.\n\n\n== 1979 ==\nOn the evening of 28 July 1979, security guard Antonio Carlos Ferreira was allegedly abducted from his workplace - a furniture factory in Mirassol, São Paulo. According to his own accounts, he was approached by three humanoid figures who tranquilized and took him aboard a small ship which ferried him to a larger craft further away. There, he said he was positioned in front of a large television-like device and presented with a variety of images before being forced to mate with a female alien, after which he was tranquilized again and returned to the ground. Ferreira described the creatures as being approximately 1.2 meters tall with pointed ears, slanted eyes and human-like mouths. They lacked eyebrows or eyelashes and spoke in a language that superficially resembled Japanese. Some were said to have dark skin and red curly hair, while others had light skin and straight black hair. The ship was spherical with three undercarriage-like legs protruding from the bottom, with the interior lit by bright red and green lights. Ferreira states that he encountered the aliens again in 1982, with the craft supposedly landing close enough for him to see the female alien and a childlike alien observing him from a distance. He said he experienced a third encounter later in 1982 in which he was taken into the hangar of an alien craft via a green beam of light before being injected with a yellow substance. He said he was then taken to meet the two aliens once more, the younger of whom he was led to believe was his own child. Other encounters are said to have followed, to a total of 16 or 20 between 1979 and 1989.\n\n\n== 1980 ==\nElias Seixas de Mattos was a truck driver from Rio de Janeiro in 1980, when he had suffered an unexplainable experience. His story, along with the ones from his two friends, has earned an important page in the history of Brazilian Ufology because of the quantity of details he displayed to describe the situations.\n\n\n== 1986 ==\nA series of UFO sightings all over the states of Southeastern Brazil.\n\n\n== 1996 ==\n\nThe Varginha UFO incident was an incident in Varginha, Brazil, in 1996 involving reports of unidentified flying objects and strange creatures (allegedly extraterrestrials) which were supposedly captured by Brazilian officials.\nIn Saragonha Island, at Patos Lagoon, Haroldo Westendorff witnessed a cone-shaped UFO, 50 to 60 meters tall, with a base as big as a soccer stadium. He flew around the object for some 15 minutes, keeping 100 meters of distance. The object was spinning around itself and heading towards the sea and was spotted at the radar of Infraero\'s room at Pelotas\' airport. It was not detected by Cindacta II in Curitiba, Paraná, which was responsible for watching the skies of southern Brazil. Westendorff also reported a smaller object coming out of the top of the big UFO, which climbed into the skies at a very fast speed, with the larger UFO following shortly afterwards. The Ministry of Aeronautics kept a secret investigation of the object seen by Westendorff.\n\n\n== 2008 ==\nIn 2014, a document called \"Dossier Riolândia\" was produced by the amateur organization Inape (Instituto de Astronomia e Pesquisa Espacial (Institute of Astronomy and Space Research in Portuguese)) which allegedly shows the appearance of UFOs in the city of Riolândia on January 20, 2008.\n\n\n== 2013 ==\nOn 19 June, a light was visible in the sky over one of the protests in Brazil, and seen by thousands attending the event. It was reported to be an UFO, but it was actually a drone used by local newspaper Folha de S. Paulo in order to shoot aerial images of the demonstrations.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of UFO sightings\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMUFON - Last 20 UFO Sightings and Pictures\nUFO-SIGHTINGS: The Unforgettable Experience\nFenomenum (Brazilian site)', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/32/Registro_de_avistamento_de_Objeto_Voador_N%C3%A3o_Identificado_-_OVNI_ocorrido_em_dezembro_de_1977'),
(55, 'Voronezh UFO incident', 'The Voronezh UFO incident was an alleged UFO sighting reported in Voronezh, Soviet Union, on September 27, 1989. The incident was allegedly witnessed by a group of children, with other members of the local community, including civil servants, claiming to have seen the craft only. The area has been popular with UFO-hunting tourists.\n\n\n== Allegations ==\nThe story reported by the Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union (TASS) claimed that a group of children had spotted a small ball in the park whilst playing (now Yuzhny Park), which quickly morphed into a disc, which landed near them. Witnesses then reported a \"three-eyed alien\" and a robot exiting the craft. The alien stared at a horrified onlooker, freezing them in their tracks, before departing and returning five minutes later to abduct a 16-year-old boy, using what was described as a 50 cm-long \"pistol tube\".Though the children were the only ones claiming to have witnessed the aliens, Lieutenant Sergei A. Matveyev of the Voronezh district police station claimed to have seen the craft. The Interior Ministry said they would dispatch troops to the area should the craft reappear.\n\n\n== Reports ==\nOn 17 September 1989, TASS reported that a correspondent had spoken to \"10 or 12 youths\" who claimed to have seen a flying saucer. The original article quoted Dr. Silanov, of the Voronezh Geophysical Laboratory, as confirming the location of the landing using biolocation. Silanov denied that he had ever made such a remark, or carried out such an experiment. The report was the most publicized of a series of UFO claims made by official government media, and were promoted as part of the government\'s new \"openness\". It was noted that, unlike in America, the reported beings were completely apolitical and did not even speak during their \'visit\'. In the immediate aftermath of the alleged incident, hundreds of UFO reports began appearing, with a reporter from Komsomolskaya Pravda even claiming to have an exclusive interview with alien beings from Red Star.To this end, the Soviet Scientific Commission ordered an official inquiry into the alleged incident. Though the area was found to have an above-average presence of the radioactive isotope cesium, the vice-rector of the University of Voronezh quickly dispensed with the idea that this was significant.In the immediate aftermath of the supposed event, only Sovietskaya Kultura and TASS attempted to pass the story off as non-fiction, with the official Communist newspaper defending its decision, saying: \"[I]ts coverage was motivated by \'the golden rule of journalism: the reader must know everything.\" The newspaper was repeatedly asked whether the report was in jest and were repeatedly assured it was not.The description of the incident was very similar to stories that appeared in the American magazine Saga, but TASS reporters stated that the witnesses \"probably haven\'t read it.\" Outside of print media, the U.S. show A Current Affair also sent a crew to report on the alleged event.In a work published by Socialist Industry slightly after the alleged incident, a self-proclaimed UFO specialist asserted the marks left by the supposed landing were simply scorch marks from a burnt hay-bale.\n\n\n== References ==', ''),
(56, 'Chiles-Whitted UFO Encounter', 'The Chiles-Whitted UFO encounter occurred on July 24, 1948 in the skies near Montgomery, Alabama. Two commercial pilots, Clarence S. Chiles and John B. Whitted, claimed that at approximately 2:45 AM on July 24 they observed a \"glowing object\" pass by their plane before it appeared to pull up into a cloud and travel out of sight. According to Air Force officer and Project Blue Book supervisor Edward J. Ruppelt, the Chiles-Whitted sighting was one of three \"classic\" UFO incidents in 1948 that convinced the personnel of Project Sign, Blue Book\'s predecessor, \"that UFOs were real.\" However, later studies by Air Force and civilian researchers indicated that Chiles and Whitted had seen a meteor, possibly a bolide, and in 1959 Project Blue Book formally stated that a meteor was the cause of the incident.\n\n\n== The incident ==\nIn the early morning hours of July 24, 1948, Clarence Chiles, chief pilot, and John Whitted, co-pilot, were flying an Eastern Airlines Douglas DC-3 passenger plane near Montgomery, at about 5,000 feet altitude. The night sky was clear with \"the Moon, four days past full, shining through scattered clouds.\"At about 2:45 AM, Chiles \"saw a dull red glow above and ahead of the aircraft.\" He told Whitted \"Look, here comes a new Army jet job.\" The object closed on their DC-3 in a matter of seconds, and both men later said they saw the object fly past the right side of their plane at high speed before it pulled \"up with a tremendous burst of flame out of its rear and zoomed up into the clouds.\" They observed the object for a total of 10 to 15 seconds. Chiles and Whitted stated that the object \"looked like a wingless aircraft...it seemed to have two rows of windows through which glowed a very bright light, as brilliant as a magnesium flare.\" Both pilots claimed the object was 100 feet long and 25-30 feet in diameter, torpedo-or-cigar shaped, \"similar to a B-29 fuselage\", with flames coming out of its tail. Only one of the plane\'s passengers, C.L. McKelvie, saw anything unusual. He reported seeing a \"bright streak of light\" that flashed by his window.\n\n\n== Investigation and explanation ==\nShortly after landing in Atlanta, Georgia, Chiles and Whitted reported their sighting to the US Air Force. They were interviewed by personnel from Project Sign, the first Air Force research group assigned to investigate UFO sightings. The personnel found that the two pilots did disagree on some details: Chiles claimed to see a lighted cockpit, long boom on the nose of the object, and the center section was transparent. Whitted did not see a cockpit or boom, and instead of the center section being transparent he claimed to see a series of rectangular windows. Neither pilot had heard any sound, and although some books and articles would later claim the plane had been hit by turbulence from the object, both pilots and the passenger who saw the \"streak of light\" stated that the plane was not affected at all by the object.USAF Captain Edward Ruppelt would write that \"according to the old-timers at ATIC (Air Technical Intelligence Center), the [Chiles-Whitted] report shook them worse than the Mantell Incident... this was the first time two reliable sources had been really close enough to a UFO to get a good look.\" Project Sign\'s personnel developed a map of the object\'s trajectory which showed that it would have passed over Macon, Georgia. When an Air Force crew chief at Robins Air Force Base near Macon reported seeing \"an extremely bright light pass overhead at high speed\" on the same night as the Chiles-Whitted incident, it \"seemed to confirm the [Chiles-Whitted] sighting\", Ruppelt wrote. According to Ruppelt, as a result of the Chiles-Whitted incident and earlier sightings in 1947 and 1948, Project Sign\'s personnel decided to send an \"Estimate of the Situation\" to Air Force Chief of Staff Hoyt S. Vandenberg. The Estimate of the Situation \"was a rather thick document with a black cover... stamped across the front were the words TOP SECRET.\" Project Sign\'s conclusion \"was that [UFOs] were interplanetary!\"However, Gen. Vandenberg rejected the Estimate of the Situation in October 1948, citing that \"the report\'s evidence was insufficient to support its conclusions.\" Additionally, Dr. J. Allen Hynek, an astronomer at Ohio State University and a scientific consultant to Project Sign, concluded that Chiles and Whitted had actually seen a very bright meteor. Dr. Hynek noted that \"the flaming tail and sudden disappearance were consistent with the brief passage of a meteor.\" Hynek also stated that a large number of bright meteors had been observed by amateur astronomers on the night of July 23-24. As for the rectangular windows and cockpit that Chiles and Whitted claimed to have seen on the object, Hynek wrote that \"It will have to be left to the psychologists to tell us whether the immediate trail of a bright meteor could produce the subjective impression of a ship with lighted windows.\" Although a Project Sign officer disagreed with Dr. Hynek\'s explanation, arguing that \"it is obvious that this object was not a meteor\" and that the object should remain labeled as unidentified, later researchers supported Dr. Hynek\'s conclusion. Dr. Donald Menzel, an astronomer at Harvard University and a prominent UFO skeptic of that era, noted that July 24 \"falls into a period of greatly increased meteor activity, when the Earth is moving through the Aquarid streams...the reports [from amateur astronomers] for the Southeast for [July 24] have particular interest for the Chiles-Whitted case.\" On the night of July 24 an observer in Alabama \"counted fifteen meteors in one hour\'s watching.\" Two days after the Chiles-Whitted sighting, a \"huge fireball flashed over North Carolina and Tennessee.\" Menzel wrote that \"when Chiles and Whitted observed the UFO, its appearance and motion were identical with those of many other bright meteors but the pilots, startled by the sudden apparition [of the meteor] misinterpreted what they saw... there can be no doubt that Chiles and Whitted misinterpreted the appearance of an unusually bright meteor, its body glowing to white and blue incandescence... shooting off flaming gases (the \"exhaust\") and vaporizing from the friction of the atmosphere.\"Menzel also recounted the experience of a pilot in 1959 who described a fiery object very similar to the one experienced by Chiles and Whitted, but which the pilot eventually recognized to be a brilliant meteor. Philip Klass, another prominent UFO skeptic, agreed with the meteor explanation, writing that the original Project Sign conclusion that the object was an interplanetary spacecraft was \"grossly in error.\" Although Dr. James E. McDonald, a physicist at the University of Arizona and a prominent ufologist, would interview Chiles and Whitted in the 1960s and conclude that they had not seen a meteor, the US Air Force, based on the analysis of Dr. Hynek, Dr. Menzel, and others, in 1959 would label the Chiles-Whitted incident as having been caused by a fireball-type meteor.\n\n\n== See also ==\nUFO sightings in the United States\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Chiles-Whitted Encounter from UFO casebook', '');

(57, 'UFOlogy', 'Ufology is the study of reports, visual records, physical evidence, and other phenomena related to unidentified flying objects (UFO). UFO reports have been subject to various investigations over the years by governments, independent groups, and scientists. However, ufology, as a field, has been rejected by modern academia and is considered a pseudoscience.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe term derives from UFO, which is pronounced as an acronym, and the suffix -logy, which comes from the Ancient Greek λογία (logiā).  An early appearance of this term in print can be found in the article \"An Introduction to Ufology\" by Ivan T. Sanderson, found in Fantastic Universe magazine\'s February 1957 issue (Vol. 7, No. 2), which closes with this direct plea: \"What we need, in fact, is the immediate establishment of a respectable new science named Ufology.\"  \nAnother early use of the word was in a 1958 speech given at the opening of The Planetary Center, a UFO research organization near Detroit, Michigan. Another early use, according to the Oxford English Dictionary, one of the first documented uses of the word ufology can be found in the Times Literary Supplement from January 23, 1959, in which it writes, \"The articles, reports, and bureaucratic studies which have been written about this perplexing visitant constitute \'ufology\'.\" This article was printed eight years after Edward J. Ruppelt of the United States Air Force (USAF) coined the word UFO in 1951.\n\n\n== Historical background ==\n\nThe modern UFO mythology has three traceable roots: the late 19th century \"mystery airships\" reported in the newspapers of the western United States, \"foo fighters\" reported by Allied airmen during World War II, and the Kenneth Arnold \"flying saucer\" sighting near Mt. Rainier, Washington on June 24, 1947. UFO reports between \"The Great Airship Wave\" and the Arnold sighting were limited in number compared to the post-war period: notable cases include reports of \"ghost fliers\" in Europe and North America during the 1930s and the numerous reports of \"ghost rockets\" in Scandinavia (mostly Sweden) from May to December 1946. Media hype in the late 1940s and early 1950s following the Arnold sighting brought the concept of flying saucers to the public audience.As the public\'s preoccupation in UFOs grew, along with the number of reported sightings, the United States military began to take notice of the phenomenon. The UFO explosion of the early post-war era coincides with the escalation of the Cold War and the Korean War. The U.S. military feared that secret aircraft of the Soviet Union, possibly developed from captured German technology, were behind the reported sightings.  If correct, the craft causing the sightings were thus of importance to national security and in need of systematic investigation. By 1952, however, the official US government interest in UFOs began to fade as the USAF projects Sign and Grudge concluded, along with the CIA\'s Robertson Panel that UFO reports indicated no direct threat to national security. The government\'s official research into UFOs ended with the publication of the Condon Committee report in 1969, which concluded that the study of UFOs in the previous 21 years had achieved little, if anything, and that further extensive study of UFO sightings was unwarranted. It also recommended the termination of the USAF special unit Project Blue Book.As the U.S. government ceased officially studying UFO sightings, the same became true for most governments of the world. A notable exception is France, which still maintains the GEIPAN, formerly known as GEPAN (1977–1988) and SEPRA (1988–2004), a unit under the French Space Agency CNES. During the Cold War, British, Canadian, Danish, Italian, and Swedish governments have each collected reports of UFO sightings. Britain\'s Ministry of Defence ceased accepting any new reports as of 2010.\n\n\n== Status as a field ==\n\nUfology has generally not been embraced by academia as a scientific field of study, even though UFOs were, during the late 1940s and early 1950s, the subject of large-scale scientific studies. The lack of acceptance of ufology by academia as a field of study means that people can claim to be \"UFO researchers\", without the sorts of scientific consensus building and, in many cases peer review, that otherwise shape and influence scientific paradigms. Even among scientifically inclined UFO research efforts, data collecting is often done by amateur investigators.Famous mainstream scientists who have shown interest in the UFO phenomenon include Stanford physicist Peter A. Sturrock, astronomer J. Allen Hynek, computer scientist and astronomer Jacques F. Vallée, and University of Arizona meteorologist James E. McDonald.\n\n\n=== As a pseudoscience ===\nUfology is characterized by scientific criticism as a partial or total pseudoscience, a characterization which many ufologists reject. Pseudoscience is a term that classifies studies that are claimed to exemplify the methods and principles of science, but that do not adhere to an appropriate scientific method, lack supporting evidence, plausibility, falsifiability, or otherwise lack scientific status.Gregory Feist, an academic psychologist, proposes that ufology can be categorized as a pseudoscience because its adherents claim it to be a science while the scientific community denies that it is, and because the field lacks a cumulative scientific progress; ufology has not, in his view, advanced since the 1950s. Rachel Cooper, a philosopher of science and medicine, states that the fundamental problem in ufology is not the lack of scientific method, as many ufologists have striven to meet standards of scientific acceptability, but rather the fact that the assumptions on which the research is often based are considered highly speculative.Stanton Friedman considers the general attitude of mainstream academics as arrogant and dismissive, or bound to a rigid worldview that disallows any evidence contrary to previously held notions. Denzler  states that the fear of ridicule and a loss of status has prevented scientists from publicly pursuing an interest in UFOs. J. Allen Hynek also commented, \"Ridicule is not part of the scientific method and people should not be taught that it is.\" Hynek said of the frequent dismissal of UFO reports by astronomers that the critics knew little about the sightings, and should thus not be taken seriously. Peter A. Sturrock suggests that a lack of funding is a major factor in the institutional lack of interest in UFOs.\n\n\n=== Methodological issues ===\nScientific UFO research suffers from the fact that the phenomena under observation do not usually make predictable appearances at a time and place convenient for the researcher. Ufologist Diana Palmer Hoyt argues,\n\nThe UFO problem seems to bear a closer resemblance to problems in meteorology than in physics. The phenomena are observed, occur episodically, are not reproducible, and in large part, are identified by statistical gathering of data for possible organization into patterns. They are not experiments that can be replicated at will at the laboratory bench under controlled conditions.\nOn the other hand, skeptics have argued that UFOs are not a scientific problem at all, as there is no tangible physical evidence to study. Barry Markovsky argues that, under scrutiny by qualified investigators, the vast majority of UFO sightings turn out to have mundane explanations. Astronomer Carl Sagan stated on UFO sightings, \"The reliable cases are uninteresting and the interesting cases are unreliable. Unfortunately there are no cases that are both reliable and interesting.\"Peter A. Sturrock states that UFO studies should be compartmentalized into at least \"the following distinct activities\":\nField investigations leading to case documentation and the measurement or retrieval of physical evidence;\nLaboratory analysis of physical evidence;\nThe systematic compilation of data (descriptive and physical) to look for patterns and so extract significant facts;\nThe analysis of compilations of data (descriptive and physical) to look for patterns and so extract significant facts;\nThe development of theories and the evaluation of those theories on the basis of facts.Denzler states that ufology as a field of study has branched into two different mindsets: the first group of investigators wants to convince the unbelievers and earn intellectual legitimacy through systematic study using the scientific method, and the second group sees the follow-up questions concerning the origin and \"mission\" of the UFOs as more important than a potential academic standing.\n\n\n=== UFO categorization ===\n\n\n==== Hynek system ====\nDeveloped in the 1970s, J. Allen Hynek\'s original system of description divides sightings into six categories. It first separates sightings into distant- and close-encounter categories, arbitrarily setting five hundred feet as the cutoff point. It then subdivides these close and distant categories based on appearance or special features:\n\nNocturnal Lights (NL): Anomalous lights seen in the night sky.\nDaylight Discs (DD): Any anomalous object, generally but not necessarily \"discoidal\", seen in the distant daytime sky.\nRadar/Visual cases (RV): Objects seen simultaneously by eye and on radar.Hynek also defined three close encounter (CE) subcategories:\n\nCE1: Strange objects seen nearby but without physical interaction with the environment.\nCE2: A CE1 case that leaves physical evidence, e.g. soil depressions, vegetation damage, radiations or causes electromagnetic interference.\nCE3: CE1 or CE2 cases where occupants or entities are seen.Later, Hynek introduced a fourth category, CE4, which is used to describe cases where the witness feels he was abducted by a UFO. Some ufologists have adopted a fifth category, CE5, which involves conscious human-initiated contact with extraterrestrial intelligence.\n\n\n==== Vallée system ====\nJacques Vallée has devised a UFO classification system, where the UFO sightings of four different categories are divided into five subcategories:\nClose Encounter (CE): As per Hynek.\nManeuver (MA): Trajectory discontinuity in flight.\nFly-by (FB): No observed discontinuity in flight.\nAnomaly (AN): Unusual lights or unexplained entities.The five subcategories can apply to all previous categories of sightings:\n\nSighting\nPhysical effects: for example, radar sighting\nLife form or living entity\nReality transformation: witnesses experienced a transformation of their sense of reality (often corresponding to the popular characterization of the incident as an abduction)\nPhysiological impact: Such as death or serious injuryThus, the Vallée categorization categorizes cases as MA-2, AN-1, CE-4, for example.\n\n\n=== Ufology and UFO reports ===\nIn addition to UFO sightings, certain supposedly related phenomena are of interest to some in the field of ufology, including crop circles, cattle mutilations, and alien abductions and implants. Some ufologists have also promoted UFO conspiracy theories, including the alleged Roswell UFO Incident of 1947, the Majestic 12 documents, and UFO disclosure advocates.Skeptic Robert Sheaffer has accused ufology of having a \"credulity explosion\". He claims a trend of increasingly sensational ideas steadily gaining popularity within ufology. Sheaffer remarked, \"the kind of stories generating excitement and attention in any given year would have been rejected by mainstream ufologists a few years earlier for being too outlandish.\"Likewise, James McDonald has expressed the view that extreme groups undermined serious scientific investigation, stating that a \"bizarre \'literature\' of pseudo-scientific discussion\" on \"spaceships bringing messengers of terrestrial salvation and occult truth\" had been \"one of the prime factors in discouraging serious scientists from looking into the UFO matter to the extent that might have led them to recognize quickly enough that cultism and wishful thinking have nothing to do with the core of the UFO problem.\" In the same statement, McDonald said that, \"Again, one must here criticize a good deal of armchair-researching (done chiefly via the daily newspapers that enjoy feature-writing the antics of the more extreme of such subgroups). A disturbing number of prominent scientists have jumped all too easily to the conclusion that only the nuts see UFOs\".\n\n\n=== Surveys of scientists and amateur astronomers concerning UFOs ===\nIn 1973, Peter A. Sturrock conducted a survey among members of the San Francisco chapter of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, where 1175 questionnaires were mailed and 423 were returned, and found no consensus concerning the nature and scientific importance of the UFO phenomenon, with views ranging equally from \"impossible\" to \"certain\" in reply to the question, \"Do UFOs represent a scientifically significant phenomenon?\"  In a later larger survey conducted among the members of the American Astronomical Society, where 2611 were questionnaires mailed and 1356 were returned, Sturrock found out that opinions were equally diverse, with 23% replying \"certainly\", 30% \"probably\", 27% \"possibly\", 17% \"probably not\", and 3% \"certainly not\", to the question of whether the UFO problem deserves scientific study. Sturrock also asked in the same survey if the surveyee had witnessed any event which they could not have identified and which could have been related to the UFO phenomenon, with around 5% replying affirmatively.In 1980, a survey of 1800 members of various amateur astronomer associations by Gert Herb and J. Allen Hynek of the Center for UFO Studies (CUFOS) found that 24% responded \"yes\" to the question, \"Have you ever observed an object which resisted your most exhaustive efforts at identification?\"\n\n\n== Studies, panels, and conferences ==\n\n\n=== Project Sign, Project Grudge (US, 1947–1949) ===\n\nThe first official USAF investigations of UFOs were Project Sign (1947–1949) and its successor Project Grudge (1949). Several hundred sightings were examined, a majority of them having a mundane explanation. Some sightings were classified as credible but inexplicable, and in these cases the possibility of an advanced unknown aircraft could not be ruled out.\nThe initial memos of the project took the UFO question seriously. After surveying 16 early reports, Lt. Col. George D. Garrett estimated that the sightings were not imaginary or exaggerations of natural phenomena. Lt. General Nathan F. Twining expressed the same estimate in a letter to Brig. General Schulgen, and urged a concerted investigation by the Air Force and other government agencies. Twining\'s memo led to the formation of Project Sign at the end of 1947. In the summer of 1948, Sign\'s first intelligence estimate (Estimate of the Situation) concluded that some UFO reports were extraterrestrial in origin. The rejection of the estimate by USAF Chief of Staff Gen. Hoyt Vandenberg led to the dissolution of Sign and the formation of Project Grudge.\n\n\n=== Flying Saucer Working Party (UK, 1950–1951) ===\n\nThe United Kingdom\'s Ministry of Defence, alarmed by reports of seemingly advanced unidentified aircraft, followed the US military\'s example by conducting its own study on UFOs in 1950. A research group was formed based on the recommendation of the chemist Henry Tizard, and was involved in similar work to \"Project Sign\". After less than a year, the directorate, named the \"Flying Saucer Working Party\" (FSWP), concluded that most observations were either cases of mistaken identity, optical illusions, psychological delusions, or hoaxes, and recommended that no further investigation on the phenomena should be undertaken. In 1952, the directorate informed Prime Minister Winston Churchill, after his inquiry about UFOs, that they had found no evidence of extraterrestrial spacecraft. The FSWP files were classified for fifty years and were released to the British public in 2001.\n\n\n=== Project Magnet, Project Second Story (Canada, 1950–1954) ===\n\nProject Magnet, led by senior radio engineer Wilbert B. Smith from the Department of Transport, had the goal of studying magnetic phenomena, specifically geomagnetism, as a potential propulsion method for vehicles. Smith believed UFOs were using this method to achieve flight. The final report of the project, however, contained no mention of geomagnetism. It discussed twenty-five UFO sightings reported during 1952, and concluded with the notion that \"extraterrestrial space vehicles\" are probable.Along with the Smith group, a parallel committee dedicated solely to dealing with \"flying saucer\" reports was formed. This committee, called Project Second Story, was sponsored by the Defence Research Board, with its main purpose being to collect, catalog, and correlate data from UFO sighting reports. The committee appeared to have dissolved after five meetings, as the group deemed the collected material unsuitable for scientific analysis.\n\n\n=== Project Blue Book (US, 1951–1969) ===\n\nAs a continuation of Project Sign and Project Grudge in 1951, the USAF launched Project Blue Book, led by Captain Edward J. Ruppelt. Under Ruppelt, the collection and investigation of UFO sightings became more systematic. The project issued a series of status reports, which were declassified in September 1960 and made available in 1968. Project Blue Book was terminated in December 1969, following the report of the Condon Committee. Until then, 12,618 incidents had been investigated, the grand majority of which explained by conventional means. 701 cases, around 6%, remained \"unidentified\". Officially, the USAF concluded from the project that the phenomena investigated were of no concern to national security, and that there was no evidence the sightings categorized as \"unidentified\" were caused by extraterrestrial aircraft.\n\n\n==== Project Blue Book Special Report No. 14 (US, 1952–1954) ====\n\nRuppelt contracted a team of scientists from the Battelle Memorial Institute to evaluate 3200 early sightings gathered by Project Blue Book. They conducted analysis, primarily statistical, on the subject for almost two years. The study concluded that the more complete the data was and the better the report, the more likely it was that the report was classified as \"unidentified\". Those reports classified as \"unidentified\" numbered 21.5% of the total (33% of the highest quality reports) and required unanimous agreement among the four project scientists, whereas \"identifieds\" required agreement by only two of four analysts.  A statistical analysis of six characteristics, such as speed and sighting duration, found statistically significant differences in at least four of the six categories between identifieds and unidentifieds.  However, the report emphasized the subjectivity of the data, and stated that the conclusions drawn from the study were not based on facts, but on the subjective observations and estimations of the individual. Furthermore, the report summary and conclusion stated that \"unknowns\" were not likely something beyond the era\'s technology, and almost certainly not \"flying saucers\".\n\n\n==== Robertson Panel (US, 1953) ====\n\nBefore the final Battelle report was published, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) had developed an interest in UFOs as a national security issue, and set up a committee to examine existing UFO data. The panel, headed by mathematician and physicist Howard P. Robertson, met from January 14 to 17, 1953. It concluded unanimously that the UFO sightings posed no direct threat to national security, but did find that a continued emphasis on UFO reporting might threaten government functions by causing the channels of communication to clog with irrelevant reports and by inducing mass hysteria. Also, the panel worried that nations hostile to the US might use the UFO phenomena to disrupt air defenses. To meet these problems, the panel stated that a policy of public education on the lack of evidence behind UFOs was needed, to be done through the mass media and schools, among others. It also recommended monitoring private UFO groups for subversive activities.The recommendations of the Roberson Panel were partly implemented through a series of special military regulations. The December 1953 Joint-Army-Navy-Air Force Publication 146 (JANAP 146) made publication of UFO sightings a crime under the Espionage Act. The Air Force Regulation 200-2 (AFR 200-2) revision of 1954 made all UFO sightings reported to the USAF classified. AFR 200-2 revision of February 1958 allowed the military to deliver to the FBI names of those who were \"illegally or deceptively\" bringing UFOs to public attention.\n\n\n==== Condon Committee (US, 1966–1968) ====\n\nAfter the recommendations of the Robertson Panel, the USAF wanted to end its involvement in UFOs, and pass Project Blue Book to another agency. In October 1966, the USAF contracted the University of Colorado, under the leadership of physicist Edward U. Condon, for $325,000 to conduct more scientific investigations of selected UFO sightings and to make recommendations about the project\'s future.\nThe committee looked at ninety-one UFO sightings, of which 30% was unidentifiable. The report concluded that there was no \"direct evidence\" that UFOs were extraterrestrial spacecraft, that UFO research from the past twenty-one years had not contributed anything to scientific knowledge, and that further study was not justified. As a direct result of the Condon report, Project Blue Book was closed in December 1969. Many ufologists, however, were not satisfied with the Condon report, and considered it a cover-up.\n\n\n=== RAND Corporation paper (US, 1968) ===\nThe RAND Corporation produced a short internal document titled \"UFOs: What to Do?\", published in November 1968. The paper gave a historical summary of the UFO phenomenon, talked briefly about issues concerning extraterrestrial life and interstellar travel, presented a few case studies and discussed the phenomenological content of a UFO sighting, reviewed hypotheses, and concluded with a recommendation to organize a central UFO report-receiving agency and conducting more research on the phenomenon.\n\n\n=== Project Identification (US, 1973–1980) ===\nIn 1973, a wave of UFO sightings in southeast Missouri prompted Harley D. Rutledge, physics professor at the University of Missouri, to conduct an extensive field investigation of the phenomenon. The findings were published in the book Project Identification: the first scientific field study of UFO phenomena. Although taking a specific interest in describing unidentified aerial phenomena, as opposed to identifying them, the book references the presumed intelligence of the sighted objects. Rutledge\'s study results were not published in any peer-reviewed journal or other scientific venue or format.\n\n\n=== Studies by GEPAN, SERPA & GEIPAN (France, 1977–present) ===\n\nIn 1977, the French Space Agency CNES Director General set up a unit to record UFO sighting reports. The unit was initially known as Groupe d’Etudes des Phénomènes Aérospatiaux Non identifiés (GEPAN), changed in 1988 to Service d\'expertise de rentrée atmosphérique Phenom (SERPA) and in 2005 to Groupe d\'études et d\'informations sur les phénomènes aérospatiaux non identifiés (GEIPAN).GEIPAN found a mundane explanation for the vast majority of recorded cases, but in 2007, after 30 years of investigation, 1,600 cases, approximately 28% of total cases, remained unexplained \"despite precise witness accounts and good-quality evidence recovered from the scene\" and are categorized as \"Type D\". In April 2010, GEIPAN statistics stated that 23% of all cases were of Type D. However, Jean-Jacques Velasco, the head of SEPRA from 1983 to 2004, wrote a book in 2004 noting that 13.5% of the 5,800 cases studied by SEPRA were dismissed without any rational explanation, and stated that UFOs are extraterrestrial in origin.\n\n\n=== United Nations (1977–1979) ===\nThanks to the lobbying of Eric Gairy, the Prime Minister of Grenada, the United Nations General Assembly addressed the UFO issue in the late 1970s. On July 14, 1978, a panel, with Gordon Cooper, J. Allen Hynek, and Jacques Vallée among its members, held a hearing to inform the UN Secretary General Kurt Waldheim about the matter. As a consequence of this meeting, the UN adopted decisions A/DEC/32/424 and A/DEC/33/426, which called for the \"establishment of an agency or a department of the United Nations for undertaking, co-ordinating and disseminating the results of research into unidentified flying objects and related phenomena\".\n\n\n=== Project Hessdalen / Project EMBLA (Norway, 1983–present / Italy 1999–2004) ===\n\nSince 1981, in an area near Hessdalen in Norway, unidentified flying objects have been commonly observed. This so-called Hessdalen phenomenon has twice been the subject of scientific field studies: Project Hessdalen (1983–1985, 1995–) secured technical assistance from the Norwegian Defense Research Establishment, the University of Oslo, and the University of Bergen, while Project EMBLA (1999–2004) was a team of Italian scientists led by Ph.D. Massimo Teodorani from the Istituto di Radioastronomia di Bologna.\nBoth studies confirmed the presence of the phenomenon and were able to record it with cameras and various technical equipment such as radar, laser, and infrared. The origin and nature of the lights remains unclear. Researchers from Project EMBLA speculated the possibility that atmospheric plasma had been the origin of the phenomenon.\n\n\n=== Project Condign (UK, 1996–2000) ===\n\nThe British Ministry of Defence (MoD) published in 2006 the \"Scientific & Technical Memorandum 55/2/00a\" of a four-volume, 460-page report entitled Unidentified Aerial Phenomena in the UK Air Defence Region, based on a study by DI55 (a section of the Directorate of Scientific and Technical Intelligence of the Defence Intelligence Staff) codenamed Project Condign. It discusses the British UFO reports received between 1959 and 1997.\nThe report affirms that UFOs are an existing phenomenon, but points out that they present no threat to national defense. The report further states that there is no evidence that UFO sightings are caused by incursions of intelligent origin, or that any UFO consists of solid objects which might create a collision hazard. Although the study admits to being unable to explain all analyzed UFO sightings with certainty, it recommends that section DI55 ceases monitoring UFO reports, as they do not provide information useful for Defence Intelligence. The report concludes that a small percentage of sightings that can not be easily explained are caused by atmospheric plasma phenomenon similar to ball lightning; Magnetic and other energy fields produced by these \"buoyant plasma formations\" are responsible for the appearance of so-called \"Black Triangles\" as well as having hallucinogenic effects on the human mind, inducing experiences of Close Encounters.\n\n\n=== Sturrock Panel Report (US, 1997) ===\nFrom Sept. 29 to Oct. 4, 1997 a workshop examining selected UFO incidents took place in Tarrytown, New York. The meeting was initiated by Peter A. Sturrock, who had reviewed the Condon report and found it dissatisfying. The international review panel consisted of nine physical scientists, who responded to eight investigators of UFO reports, who were asked to present their strongest data. The final report of the workshop was published under the title \"Physical Evidence Related to UFO Reports\" in the Journal of Scientific Exploration in 1998. The study concluded that the studied cases presented no unequivocal evidence for the presence of unknown physical phenomena or for extraterrestrial intelligence, but argued that a continued study of UFO cases might be scientifically valuable.\n\n\n=== COMETA Report (France, 1999) ===\nCOMETA (Comité d\'Études Approfondies, \"Committee for in-depth studies\") is a private French group, which is mainly composed of high-ranking individuals from the French Ministry of Defence. In 1999 the group published a ninety-page report entitled \"Les OVNI et la défense: à quoi doit-on se préparer?\" (\"UFOs and Defense: What Should We Prepare For?\"). The report analyzed various UFO cases and concluded that UFOs are real, complex flying objects, and that the extraterrestrial hypothesis has a high probability of being the correct explanation for the UFO phenomenon. The study recommended that the French government should adjust to the reality of the phenomenon and conduct further research. Skeptic Claude Maugé criticized COMETA for research incompetency, and claimed that the report tried to present itself as an official French document, when in fact it was published by a private group.\n\n\n=== \"Disclosure Project\" Press Conference (US, 2001) ===\n\nOn May 9, 2001, twenty government workers from military and civilian organizations spoke about their experiences regarding UFOs and UFO confidentiality at the National Press Club in Washington D.C.. The press conference was initiated by Steven M. Greer, founder of the Disclosure Project, which has the goal of disclosing alleged government UFO secrecy. The purpose of the press conference was to build public pressure through the media to obtain a hearing before the United States Congress on the issue. Although major American media outlets reported on the conference, the interest quickly died down, and no hearing came forth.\n\n\n=== Fife Symington Press Conference (US, 2007) ===\nOn November 12, 2007, a press conference, moderated by former Governor of Arizona Fife Symington, was held at the National Press Club in Washington D.C. Nineteen former pilots and military and civilian officials spoke about their experiences with UFOs, demanding that the U.S. government engage in a new investigation of the phenomenon.\n\n\n== UFO organizations ==\n\n\n=== United States ===\nIn the US, groups and affiliates interested in UFO investigation number in the hundreds, of which a few have achieved prominence based on their longevity, size, and researcher involvement with scientific credentials. The first significant UFO interest group in the US was the Aerial Phenomena Research Organization (APRO), formed in 1952 by Coral and James Lorenzen. The organization closed down in 1988. The National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP), which formed in 1957 and shut down in the 1970s, whose Board of Directors included former Director of Central Intelligence and first head of the Central Intelligence Agency, VADM Roscoe H. Hillenkoetter, was, at one time, the largest UFO organization in the country, with numerous chapters. In 1957, brothers W. H. and J. A. Spaulding founded the Ground Saucer Watch, which later became famous when, in 1977, the group filed a suit under the Freedom of Information Act against the CIA.The two major UFO investigative groups active today are the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON), founded in 1969, and the Center for UFO Studies (CUFOS), founded in 1973 by J. Allen Hynek. MUFON grew as the key members of NICAP joined the organization in the 1970s. CUFOS has tried to limit its membership to established researchers, but has found little academic acceptance.National UFO Reporting Center takes UFO reports, and has been in operation since 1974.\n\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\nThe British UFO Research Association (BUFORA) is the oldest of the active British UFO organizations. It traces its roots to the London UFO Research Association, founded in 1959, which merged with the British UFO Association (BUFOA) to form BUFORA in 1964.\n\n\n=== Australia ===\n\nThe Australian Flying Saucer Bureau (AFSB) and the Australian Flying Saucer Research Society (AFSRS) were the earliest UFO groups established in Australia, with both being founded in the early 1950s. The Australian Centre for UFO Studies (ACUFOS) was established in 1974 with links to the American CUFOS. Other currently active Australian UFO groups include the Victorian UFO Research Society (VUFORS), the\nAustralian UFO Research Network (AUFORN), and UFO Research Queensland (UFORQ).\n\n\n=== Switzerland ===\nThe Freie Interessengemeinschaft für Grenz- und Geisteswissenschaften und Ufologiestudien (Free Community of Interests for the Border and Spiritual Sciences and Ufological Studies) (FIGU) is a non-profit, tax-paying organization established under the name mentioned. This organization was established by Eduard Albert Meier (Billy Meier) in 1996 with its headquarters based in Schmidrüti, Switzerland. \n\n\n=== Skeptic organizations ===\n\nThe Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (CSI), although not a UFO organization, has investigated various UFO cases and has given a skeptical review of the phenomena in its publications, often in the Skeptical Inquirer magazine. Founded as the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal (CSICOP) in 1976 by professor of philosophy Paul Kurtz, the committee is known for its member scientists and skeptics, such as Carl Sagan, Isaac Asimov, Philip J. Klass, Ray Hyman, James Randi, and Martin Gardner. The Skeptics Society, founded by science historian Michael Shermer in 1992, has also addressed the UFO issue in its magazine Skeptic.\n\n\n=== World UFO Day ===\nWorld UFO Day is a day for people to gather together and watch the skies for unidentified flying objects. The goal of the July 2 celebration is to raise awareness of the Roswell findings, and to gain support in forcing governments to \"tell the truth about earthly visits from outer space aliens\". This day is celebrated in the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, Canada, China, Thailand, Belgium, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Japan, Netherlands, South Africa, Taiwan, Turkey, the Czech Republic, Australia, Spain, Korea, Brazil, Italy, France, Nigeria, Finland, Austria and Poland.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nAcademic books about ufology as a sociological and historical phenomenonDenzler, Brenda (2003).

(58, 'Center for UFO Studies', 'The Center for UFO Studies (CUFOS) is a privately funded UFO research group. The group was founded in 1973 by J. Allen Hynek, who at the time was Chair of the Department of Astronomy at Northwestern University in Illinois.\n\n\n== History ==\nHynek was a scientific consultant for Project Blue Book, the United States Air Force official study of the UFO phenomenon from 1948 to 1969. Although Hynek started out as a skeptic and helped the Air Force to debunk most UFO reports, he gradually became convinced that a small number of UFO cases were not hoaxes or explainable as misidentifications of natural phenomena, and that these cases might represent something extraordinary — even alien visitation from other planets. When the Air Force shut down Project Blue Book in 1969, Hynek, in 1973, founded the Center for UFO Studies (CUFOS) to continue to collect and study UFO reports. Ufologist James W. Moseley wrote that CUFOS was \"... the first real attempt to set up a private research group genuinely dedicated to scientific investigations and study of UFOs.\" Moseley observed that CUFOS \"wasn\'t a saucer club and, for a while, wasn\'t open to general membership. Participation was restricted to scientists and other professionals who donated their time and expertise, Hynek\'s invisible college. This wouldn\'t last — though CUFOS has.\"\n\n\n== Operation ==\nStarted in Evanston, Illinois, but now based in Chicago, CUFOS continues to be a small research organization stressing scientific analysis of UFO cases. Its extensive archives include historically valuable files from defunct civilian research groups such as National Investigations Committee On Aerial Phenomena (NICAP), the largest UFO research group of the 1950s and 1960s. Following Hynek\'s death in 1986, CUFOS was renamed the J. Allen Hynek Center for UFO Studies in his honor. The Director of CUFOS since 1986 has been Mark Rodeghier. Ufologists who have served on the CUFOS Board of Directors are Jerome Clark, UFO historian and author of The UFO Encyclopedia; Michael D. Swords, a retired professor of natural science at Western Michigan University; and Thomas E. Bullard, a folklorist at Indiana University.The Center for UFO Studies (CUFOS) has two principal activities. First, it maintains a library and archives of UFO-related materials, which are open for use by researchers and investigators who are writing about UFO-related topics. These materials include books, articles, documents, and sighting reports. Second, CUFOS continues to compile and analyze reports of UFO incidents from around the world.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of UFO organizations\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nClark, Jerome.

(59, 'Lockheed EC-121 Warning Star', 'The Lockheed EC-121 Warning Star was an American Airborne early warning and control radar surveillance aircraft used from the 1950s by the United States Navy and United States Air Force.\nThis military version of the Lockheed L-1049 Super Constellation was designed to serve as an airborne early warning system to supplement the Distant Early Warning Line, using two large radomes, a vertical dome above and a horizontal one below the fuselage. Some EC-121s were also used for intelligence gathering (SIGINT).\nIt was introduced in 1954 and retired from service in 1978, although a single specially modified EW aircraft remained in service with the U.S. Navy until 1982. \nThe U.S. Navy versions when initially procured were designated WV-1 (PO-1W), WV-2, and WV-3. Warning Stars of the U.S. Air Force served during the Vietnam War as both electronic sensor monitors and as a forerunner to the Boeing E-3 Sentry AWACS. U.S. Air Force aircrews adopted the civil nickname, \"Connie\" (diminutive of Constellation) as reference, while naval aircrews used the term \"Willie Victor\" based on a slang version of the NATO phonetic alphabet and the Navy\'s pre-1962 \"WV-\" designations for the aircraft type.\n\n\n== Development ==\n\nSince 1943 the Lockheed Constellation had been in USAAF service as the C-69. The use of the Constellation by the U.S. Navy for patrol and airborne early warning duties was first investigated in 1949, when the Navy acquired two Lockheed L-749 Constellations. First flown on 9 June 1949, the PO-1W carried large, long-range radars in massive radomes above and below the fuselage. As the radomes possessed considerably more side area, the vertical stabilizers of the PO-1W had to be enlarged. After the PO-1W, which was redesignated WV-1 in 1952, had proved that it was possible to operate large radars on aircraft, the U.S. Navy ordered the WV-2 based on the L-1049 Super Constellation. The WV-1s were transferred to the Federal Aviation Agency in 1958–1959.The WV-2/EC-121D was initially fitted with a dorsal AN/APS-45 height finder radar and a ventral AN/APS-20 air search radar. These radars were later upgraded to AN/APS-103 and AN/APS-95 radars, although not simultaneously. The crew commonly numbered 18,  six officers (two pilots, two navigators, two weapons controllers) and 12 enlisted personnel (two flight engineers, one radio operator, two crew chiefs, five radar operators, two radar technicians). However, when North Korea shot down a Navy EC-121 in 1969, a crew of 31 was on board.Orders were placed totaling 142 PO-2W Constellations based on the Lockheed L-1049 Super Constellation with deliveries beginning in 1953. The type was redesignated WV-2 in 1954. The WV-2 was familiarly known to its crews as \"Willy Victor\". In 1962, with standardization of aircraft designations within the Department of Defense, the WV-2 then became the EC-121K. A total of 13 of these were converted to WV-2Q electronic intelligence aircraft (which became EC-121M in 1962), and nine were converted to WV-3 weather reconnaissance aircraft (WC-121N in 1962).  The EC-121K was also operated by Training Squadron 86 (VT-86) at NAS Glynco, Georgia for training of Student Naval Flight Officers destined to fly both the EC-121 and the Grumman E-2 Hawkeye.  When NAS Glynco was closed and VT-86 transferred to NAS Pensacola, Florida in 1973, the squadron\'s last EC-121 was also flown to NAS Pensacola for transfer to the collection of the National Museum of Naval Aviation where it remains today.  A single aircraft became an NC-121K, an electronic warfare variant assigned to Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron 33 (VAQ-33) at NAS Key West, Florida.  This aircraft was the last EC-121 in operational service, flying until 25 June 1982.The Air Force received 10 RC-121C and 74 EC-121D Warning Stars also based on the L-1049 beginning with diversions from the Navy contracts in October 1953. The 10 RC-121Cs became trainers, designated TC-121C. Between 1966 and 1969, 30 retired Navy EC-121s were transferred to the USAF and converted in EC-121Rs as sensor-monitoring aircraft. Of the 74 EC-121s, 42 were converted to the EC-121H upgrade beginning in 1962, and in 1969, 15 of the remaining EC-121Ds and seven of the EC-121Hs were further upgraded into the final operational variant, the EC-121T, which served as an AWACS prototype in Southeast Asia in 1972. Five EC-121Ds were modified to be broadcasting aircraft for psychological warfare operations, the predecessors of the EC-130 Commando Solo.\n\n\n== Operational service ==\n\n\n=== U.S. Navy ===\nWV-2s, later redesignated as EC-121s in 1962, served from 1954 to 1965 in two \"barrier\" forces, one off each coast of the North American continent. These barrier forces consisted of five surface picket stations each manned by radar destroyer escorts and an air wing of WV-2s/EC-121s that patrolled the picket lines at 1,000–4,000 m (3,000–12,000 ft) altitude in six- to 20-hour missions. Their objective was to extend early warning coverage against surprise Soviet bomber and missile attack as an extension of the DEW Line.In April 1954 the first Lockheed Super Constellation (Model 1049C), WV-2 BuNo. 128323, was received at NAS Barbers Point by Airborne Early Warning Squadron One (VW-1).\n\nThe Atlantic Barrier (BarLant) consisted of two rotating squadron detachments sourced from Airborne Early Warning Squadron THIRTEEN (VW-13) and Airborne Early Warning Squadron FIFTEEN (VW-15) home based at NAS Patuxent River, Maryland, and one squadron, Airborne Early Warning Squadron ELEVEN (VW-11), permanently based at Naval Station Argentia, Newfoundland. The mission was to fly orbits to the Azores and back. There was an additional AEW Training Unit based at NAS Patuxent River for training flight crews and maintenance personnel.\nBarLant began operations on 1 July 1956, and flew continuous coverage until early 1965. The Barrier was shifted to cover the approaches between Greenland, Iceland, and the United Kingdom (GIUK) barrier in June 1961. Aircraft from Argentia were staged through NAS Keflavik, Iceland, to extend coverage times.The Pacific Barrier received the first operational Airborne Early Warning squadron, Airborne Early Warning Squadron One (VW-1), and the first EC-121K aircraft. Airborne Early Warning Squadron Three followed with Airborne Early Warning Squadron Twelve, Airborne Early Warning Squadron Fourteen, and Airborne Early Warning Squadron Sixteen. In January of 1958 VW-1 and VW-3 were relocated to NAS Agana, Guam, M.I. where VW-1 continued it\'s AEW commitments and VW-3 operational commitment was divided between AEW and Weather. (BarPac) began operations with Airborne Early Warning Squadron TWELVE (VW-12) based at NAS Barbers Point, Hawaii, operating from a deployment  base at NAS Midway, on 1 July 1958, and later expanded to include Airborne Early Warning Squadron FOURTEEN (VW-14) and Airborne Early Warning Squadron SIXTEEN (VW-16). Their orbits overlapped the radar picket stations of the ships of Escort Squadron Seven (CORTRON SEVEN), from roughly Adak Island to Midway. Normally four or five WV-2s/EC-121s were required at any single time to provide coverage over the entire line.\nThe Hawaiian Barrier Force operations were discontinued by September 1965 and their EC-121K aircraft placed in storage. However, VW-1 continured to operate until 1972 flying weather operations and supplying Airborne Early Warning to Naval forces in the Gulf of TonkinU.S. Navy C-121, EC-121, WC-121 and NC-121 operations continued until 1975 in seven other squadrons and until 1982 in an 8th. Some EC-121s were used in Vietnam, mirroring USAF EC-121 missions  but orbiting Gulf of Tonkin, as that was Navy\'s assigned area. \nFleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron ONE (VQ-1) and Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron TWO (VQ-2) operated EC-121M intelligence gathering aircraft at NAF Atsugi, Japan, and Naval Station Rota, Spain, respectively, until they transitioned to the EP-3B Orion and EP-3E Aries aircraft.\nWeather Reconnaissance Squadron FOUR (VW-4) operated WV-3 Willy Victors-cum-WC-121s between 1954 and 1975 as Hurricane Hunters, with its primary base at NAS Jacksonville, Florida and a forward base at Naval Station Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico, while its Pacific counterpart,Weather Reconnaissance Squadron Three (VW-3) Typhoon Trackers was the operational weather squadron in the Pacific, flew out of NAS Agana, Guam, tracking typhoons from 1955 to 1960. On June 30, 1960 Weather Reconnaissance Squadron Three, VW-3, was decommissioned. Many of its aircraft (eight - BuNo. 145 series) and men were absorbed by VW-1,which retained the AEW designation and took on the weather commitments and the Title of \"Typhoon Trackers\" of VW-3.  VW-4 later transitioned to the WP-3A Orion.\nAlso operating C-121 and EC-121 aircraft was Oceanographic Development Squadron EIGHT (VXN-8) at NAS Patuxent River, Maryland, which employed the aircraft for specific projects (e.g., Project BIRDSEYE, etc.) for the Office of Naval Research until they were replaced by RP-3A and RP-3D Orion aircraft.  Air Development Squadron SIX (VX-6, based at NAS Quonset Point, Rhode Island, also operated R7V aircraft, later redesignated as the C-121J, in support of United States Antarctic Program operations until replaced by LC-130F Hercules aircraft.\nThe EC-121 was also operated by Training Squadron 86 (VT-86) at NAS Glynco, Georgia for training Student Naval Flight Officers destined for the E-2 Hawkeye and by Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron 33 (VAQ-33) for the Fleet Electronic Warfare Systems Group (FEWSG) at NAS Norfolk, Virginia and later, following a squadron homeport change, at NAS Key West, Florida.  At the time of its retirement on June 25, 1982, VAQ-33\'s NC-121K aircraft, Buno 141292 was the last NC-121K and the last of its type operated by the U.S. Navy.\n\n\n=== U.S. Air Force ===\nThe United States Air Force between 1954 and 1978 operated EC-121s in three wings at maximum employment, and three independent squadrons as its operations wound down. Until the Vietnam War, the primary mission of EC-121s was to provide complementary early warning radar coverage to the Pacific and Atlantic barriers by flying orbits 300 miles offshore of the continental United States in what was termed \"Contiguous Barriers\". Their coverage orbits overlapped those of land-based early warning radars.\n\nInitial deployment of EC-121Cs began with the 551st Airborne Early Warning and Control Wing, based at Otis Air Force Base, Massachusetts. Operational on 21 December 1954, the 551st AEWCW subsequently upgraded to EC-121D and later EC-121H Warning Stars. Its Pacific counterpart was the 552nd AEWCW, based at McClellan Air Force Base, California, which became operational on 1 July 1955. After the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962, the 552nd AEWCW also had administrative control of the 966th AEWCS, based at McCoy Air Force Base, Florida. The 966th had a dual mission: monitoring activity in Cuban airspace and flying Gold Digger missions (continuous tracks of U-2 surveillance missions).The third Wing to operate EC-121s was the 553rd Reconnaissance Wing, a Vietnam war organization activated in October 1967 and based in Thailand until its inactivation in December 1970 (See BatCat below). In 1966 Lockheed modified 30 ex-USN Super Constellations (2 EC-121P/WV-3 and 28 EC-121K/WV-2) aircraft to EC-121R for the specialized reconnaissance mission flown by the 553rd. Aircraft were delivered to the wing during the course of 1967. The 553rd RW flew over land and off the coast of Vietnam, over Laos and Cambodia, monitoring and retransmitting low-power signals. Usually they orbited the Ho Chi Minh Trail in eight-hour shifts. As it was expensive to operate and it exposed a large crew to enemy fire it was replaced in December 1970 by the much smaller (and eventually unmanned drone) QU-22 Pave Eagle sensor monitor.The 551st AEWCW inactivated in 1969, while the 552d was reduced by a squadron in 1971. On 1 July 1974, the Air Force redesignated the 552d Airborne Early Warning and Control Wing as the 552d Airborne Warning and Control Group when it was downsized to a single squadron.  It was inactivated on 30 April 1976. As the USAF prepared to deploy the E-3 Sentry in the later 1970s, the Air Force phased out EC-121 operations by the end of 1975. All remaining EC-121s were transferred to the Air Force Reserve, which formed the 79th AEWCS at Homestead Air Force Base, Florida in early 1976. The active duty force continued to provide personnel to operate the EC-121s on a 24-hour basis, assigning Detachment 1, 20th Air Defense Squadron to Homestead AFB as associate active duty crews to fly the Reserve-owned aircraft. Besides monitoring Cuban waters, these last Warning Stars also operated from NAS Keflavik, Iceland. Final EC-121 operations ended in September 1978. Detachment 1 was dissolved and 79th AEWCS was re-designated a fighter squadron on 1 October 1978.\nIn 1967, five EC-121S became operational with the 193rd Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron of the Pennsylvania Air National Guard, responsible for psyops missions under project Coronet Solo. From July 1970 to January 1971 they rotated on 30- to 90-day temporary duty deployments to Korat Royal Thai Air Force Base, Thailand, under the name Commando Buzz.\n\n\n== Vietnam War ==\nEC-121s were used extensively in Southeast Asia between 16 April 1965, and 1 June 1974, particularly in support of Operation Rolling Thunder and Operation Linebacker/Linebacker II to provide radar early warning and limited airborne control of USAF fighter forces engaging MiG interceptors. Flying orbits over the Gulf of Tonkin and later over Laos, they were the forerunners of Airborne Early Warning and Control aircraft. The U.S. Navy used a variant,the NC-121 in their Blue Eagle unit from 1965–1972. The Blue Eagles were radar jamming and radio broadcast airplanes. The Blue Eagles were based in NAS Patuxent River and were part of oceanographic squadron VXN-8.\n\n\n=== Big Eye ===\n\nAt the onset of Rolling Thunder, the North Vietnamese had an advantage in that their radar coverage could detect most U.S. strike aircraft flying at 5000 feet or above virtually anywhere in the country, using a system that was difficult to jam. U.S. forces countered with radar ships (Crown) in the Gulf of Tonkin and a ground site at Nakhon Phanom RTAFB, Thailand, but both systems were line of sight and had serious gaps in coverage.\nTo increase coverage the Seventh Air Force (7 AF) requested airborne radar support and the Air Defense Command (redesignated Aerospace Defense Command in 1968) was directed to set up the Big Eye Task Force.  Five EC-121Ds and 100 support personnel of the 552nd AEWCW at McClellan AFB were deployed to Tainan Air Station, Taiwan, with four of the EC-121s sent on to a forward operating location at Tan Son Nhut Air Base, near Saigon, Republic of Vietnam.The EC-121s were designed for detection of aircraft flying over water, and ground clutter (spurious signal returns off of terrain features such as mountains) caused interference with their radar pictures. Their crews, however, were experienced in tracking Soviet aircraft over Cuba and had developed a technique whereby an EC-121 flying at 50 to 300 feet could bounce a signal from its bottom-mounted APS-95 Search radar off the surface of the water and detect aircraft at medium altitudes out to 150 miles. Operating in pairs, one Big Eye EC-121 flew a 50-mile race track pattern  approximately 30 miles offshore (the Alpha orbit), with the orbit\'s center at 19°25′N 107°25′E. The second flew a track at 10,000 ft (the Bravo orbit) farther from the coast, acting as a spare for the Alpha EC-121.\n\nThis provided a practical detection range of 100 miles, just enough to cover the Hanoi urban area and the main MiG base at Phúc Yên. A major disadvantage of this arrangement, however, was that most MiG contacts were beyond the 70-mile range of the Big Eye\'s APS-45 Height Finder radar, so that they were unable to provide this crucial data to USAF strike forces. Furthermore, technical shortcomings in the EC-121D\'s systems precluded either controlling a fighter intercept or identifying a specific flight under attack.The missions from Tan Son Nhut AB began 21 April 1965, using the call signs Ethan Alpha and Ethan Bravo, which became standard. After refueling at Danang Air Base, Ethan Alpha made a wave-top approach to its orbit station, where it remained five hours. Because of the threat of MiG interception, EC-121s were protected by a MiGCAP of Lockheed F-104 Starfighters, and if for any reason the MiGCAP could not rendezvous, the EC-121s cancelled their mission. Air conditioning systems aboard the EC-121 were virtually useless in this profile and the heat produced by the electronics, combined with the threat of being shot down, made Alpha orbit missions in particular highly stressful. On 10 July 1965, in its first airborne-controlled interception, an EC-121 provided warning to a pair of U.S. F-4C fighters, resulting in the shooting down of two MiG-17s.The Big Eye Task Force remained at Tan Son Nhut until February 1967, when the threat of Viet Cong ground attacks prompted a move to Thailand.\n\n\n=== College Eye ===\nOn 1 March 1967, Big Eye was renamed College Eye Task Force and relocated at Ubon Royal Thai Air Force Base. Because of the complexity of the aircraft and its systems along with the large support group it required, the CETF was not a welcome tenant at the relatively small Thai bases. It moved to Udon RTAFB in July and to its final station at Korat RTAFB on 17 October 1967. Seven of 26 EC-121s deployed from Otis AFB and arrived at Korat, on the 19th.From April 1965 to early 1966 and beginning again in late 1967, the EC-121Ds also controlled a flight of MiGCAP fighters for unarmed support aircraft operating over the Gulf. The EC-121Ds also served as an airborne communications relay center for strike aircraft to transmit mission results and position reports to the control center at Danang; directed operations of fighter escorts, MiGCAPs, Lockheed C-130 Hercules flare ships, and A-26 strike aircraft along the North Vietnamese-Laotian border; provided radar and navigational assistance for Combat Search and Rescue missions; and assisted fighters in finding tankers for emergency refueling.\n\nThe government of China on 12 May 1966, formally protested an incursion by an Republic F-105 Thunderchief pursuing a North Vietnamese MiG it subsequently shot down 25 miles inside Chinese territory. A U.S. board of inquiry recommended that College Eye also monitor the \"no-fly zone\" inside the North Vietnamese border with China, provide alerts to U.S. aircraft nearing the buffer zone, and report border crossing violations by U.S. aircraft. This could not be done from the Gulf and a third orbit, called Ethan Charlie, was created in Laos. After tests in June and August, regular missions began 24 August. There were not enough EC-121s or crews to support three orbits twice daily, so the Laotian orbit was only flown every third day, with Ethan Bravo missions canceled on those days. After 13 October 1966, the Charlie orbit was flown every day and the Bravo orbit suspended altogether. In April 1967, four more EC-121s were deployed, two to Thailand on 29 May, making for a total strength of three College Eyes in Taiwan and six in Thailand.In April 1967, the Air Force began fitting its entire EC-121 fleet with the QRC-248 IFF transponder interrogator. The QRC-248 had been developed to surveil Soviet-export aircraft flown by the Cuban Air Force. The SRO-2 transponders installed in Soviet export MiGs enabled Cuban ground-controlled interception (GCI) radars to identify and control their fighters. A testbed EC-121 called Quick Look had flown with College Eye in January 1967 to test the QRC-248 and found that North Vietnamese MiGs used the same transponder. QRC-248 accurately discriminated MiG radar returns from the myriad returns picked up during a mission, and extended the range of low-altitude detection to more than 175 miles, covering virtually all important North Vietnamese target areas.By 31 May, all College Eyes had been fitted with QRC-248. The mission of the Bravo orbit was changed from that of a backup for the Alpha orbit to being the primary QRC-248 listener. However College Eye was prohibited by the Joint Chiefs of Staff from actively \"interrogating\" MiG transponders, following a National Security Agency security policy protecting its \"intelligence sources\" (of which the QRC-248 was one), and thus was restricted to waiting for North Vietnamese GCI to interrogate its aircraft. QRC-248 began regular use on 21 July 1967, but by then North Vietnam\'s MiG force, which had suffered serious losses in May, had suspended combat operations.In the last week of August, however, after a period of intensive training and revision of tactics, the MiGs began to engage U.S. strike forces again, scoring a number of kills. Seventh Air Force finally obtained permission for the Bravo orbit EC-121 to actively interrogate with the QRC-248 on 6 October. By 4 December, its success outweighed any value in flying the Alpha orbit, which was discontinued until July 1972.On 1 March 1968, the College Eye call signs were changed to Ethan 01, 02, 03, and 04 in conformity with standard Air Force procedures. Ethan 03 (the Laotian orbit) began \"positive control\" (airborne direction) of C-130 flare ship flights and A-26 Invader night interdiction missions along the Ho Chi Minh Trail in Laos on 19 April 1968.The task force was scaled back on 1 July 1968, to four EC-121Ds and the Rivet Top testbed aircraft to allow for the basing of another College Eye detachment at Itazuke AB, Japan. The name of the task force was discontinued on 30 October 1968, when it was redesignated a final time as Detachment 1 (Rotational), 552nd AEWCW. The EC-121 deployments to Southeast Asia were discontinued in June 1970 in the expectation that they would no longer be utilized.\n\n\n=== Rivet Top ===\nOn 9 August 1967, while the College Eye Task Force was still based at Udon RTAFB, another prototype EC-121 variation began operations testing new equipment as Detachment 2 of the Tactical Air Warfare Center. Known as Rivet Top, this modified EC-121K (later re-designated EC-121M) carried the QRC-248 newly installed in the College Eye aircraft, but also had electronic interrogators capable of reading two additional Soviet transponders, the SRO-1 and SOD-57. Its electronics were custom built rather than off-the-shelf. However its most important upgrade was the highly secret Rivet Gym installation. This consisted of the addition to the crew of Vietnamese-speaking intelligence specialists who manned four voice communication intercept stations able to monitor all communications between the MiGs and their GCI controllers.\n\nDespite this advantage, the Rivet Top experienced two problems which reduced its effectiveness. Its listeners did not have radar scopes to correlate intercepted conversations with specific flights of MiGs, and thus could not determine which U.S. aircraft might be under attack. Secondly, like QRC-248, Rivet Gym was a Signals intelligence (SIGINT) asset of the National Security Agency, and subject to even more stringent rules protecting knowledge of its existence. Even when real-time warnings to U.S. aircraft were finally permitted in mid-1972, fighter crews were not made aware of the source of the warnings and because EC-121 radio communications were poor, mandating the use of a radio relay aircraft that often failed, they tended to disregard the credibility of the source.The Rivet Top prototype moved to Korat RTAFB along with the College Eye Task Force in October 1967. Originally scheduled to return to the United States in February 1968, because of its value it remained at Korat until 1969. Flying daily missions through its testing period, it began flying every-other-day missions over the Gulf of Tonkin after 31 March 1968, when Rolling Thunder operations were sharply scaled back. Rivet Gym installations were back-fitted to all College Eye EC-121s by the end of May 1968.\n\n\n=== Operation Kingpin ===\nTwo EC-121Ds, newly modified with the Southeast Asia Operational Requirement 62 (SEAOR-62) electronics suite but not yet operational as EC-121Ts, were ordered to Korat RTAFB on 29 October 1970. Under the guise of being field tested, they were accompanied by a C-121G carrying additional crew members, the most experienced technicians of the 552nd AEWCW, and equipment necessary to maintain the new electronics suite. The SEAOR-62 package was supported by a digital data receiver ground terminal and by radio relay equipment transshipped by separate classified airlift. The EC-121Ts arrived in Thailand from McClellan AFB on 12 November.The purpose of the deployment was to provide an integrated tactical data display with real-time inputs (similar to the Navy Airborne Tactical Data System equipping E-1B Tracer platforms of Task Force 77) in support of Operation Kingpin, a mission to rescue American prisoners of war held at Son Tay prison. Once at Korat, some equipment was tested for the first time because of emission restrictions in U.S. airspace, and the only available manuals and checklists were notes from early flight tests. Even so, both aircraft were operational by 17 November.On 20 November 1970, the two Warning Stars, using the call signs Frog 01 and Frog 02 respectively, took off ten minutes apart at 22:00 from Korat to take station at the low altitude Alpha orbit over the Gulf of Tonkin, with Frog 02 as a backup standby. The 17-man crews were advised in the air of the nature of the rescue mission and their role, providing MiG warning and directing Air Force F-4 Phantom CAP intercepts. As Frog 01 began its climb to the higher Bravo orbit, it experienced a ruptured oil line that forced the shutdown of one engine. As planned, Frog 02 became the primary aircraft when Frog 01 made an emergency landing at Danang.The new equipment failed to function properly aboard Frog 02. The ground receivers at the command post in Danang failed to receive data, and the APX-83 IFF processors would not display aboard the aircraft, despite repeated repairs. Their own radar monitors experienced excessive electronic noise, and the jamming of North Vietnamese radars by nearby EKA-3B Skywarriors hindered efforts of the radar technicians to correct the problems. While unable to provide vectoring information to the F-4s escorting the mission, Frog 02 remained on station and relied on its Rivet Top voice intercept capability to provide supplementary data.\n\n\n=== Disco ===\nIn October 1971, North Vietnamese MiGs, operating from forward bases opened after the end of Rolling Thunder, began a campaign to intercept missions by Boeing B-52 Stratofortresses over southern Laos. On 20 November, a MiG-21 launched air-to-air missiles at a B-52 that evaded by dropping flares. As a result, Warning Stars of Det. 1 returned to Korat RTAFB to provide radar support by flying the Laotian orbit again, using the call sign Disco. Seven EC-121Ts, replacement aircraft for the earlier series, were based in Thailand and contained both QRC-248 and Rivet Top electronic suites.\n\nWhen Operation Linebacker began on 10 May 1972, Disco was one of two principal GCI radars used by U.S. forces, although it continued to be handicapped by poor radio communications. In addition, its slow turning radar limited its value as a controller of fighters during MiG engagements, while the size of USAF raids during Linebacker nearly saturated its capabilities. However the improvements made in the systems since 1968 enabled the radar operators to distinguish MiG types, and a color code system for them entered the air operations vernacular: \"Red Bandits\" (Mig-17s); \"White Bandits\" (MiG-19s); \"Blue Bandits\" (MiG-21)s, and \"Black bandits\" (MiGs low on fuel).On 6 July 1972, as the result of seven F-4 Phantoms shot down in one two-week period, a second Disco track was initiated. Flown near the former Alpha orbit over the Gulf of Tonkin, its purpose was to gain better low-altitude coverage in the Hanoi area. At the end of the month Disco was also integrated into the Teaball control center, a highly classified system established to collate all signal intelligence on North Vietnamese air activity gathered by all sources, including nonmilitary. Disco was used as a conduit through which warnings and control vectors were given, but the delay in Teaball acquiring the information and relaying it through Disco (which often had to use an unreliable radio relay KC-135A Combat Lightning aircraft operating under the call sign Luzon) cancelled out its value for use in \"real time\", and the fact that its existence was kept from U.S. air crews damaged its credibility. Teaball received direct communications capability but experienced transmission failures with frustrating frequency. Disco remained the primary backup controller but its usefulness remained limited because it directly controlled only MiGCAP missions and could only provide its information to strike, chaff, and escort forces via the \"Guard\" frequency.On 15 August 1973, Disco EC-121s flew their final combat mission, and on 1 June 1974, Detachment 1 was permanently withdrawn from Southeast Asia. Between 1965 and 1973, the EC-121s flew 13,921 combat missions; more than 98,000 accident-free flying hours, assisted in the shoot-down of 25 MiGs and supported the rescue of 80 downed flyers. No Big Eye, College Eye, or Disco aircraft were lost.\n\n\n=== Batcat ===\n\nDuring the Vietnam War some 40 EC-121s were modified from U.S. Navy WV-2 and WV-3 early warning Constellations for use with ground sensors to detect enemy troop movements along the Ho Chi Minh Trail, and 25 were deployed to Korat RTAFB as a part of Operation Igloo White.  The resulting EC-121R configuration was nicknamed the Batcat. Two Batcats were lost during the war, with the loss of 22 crewmen, one in a takeoff accident during a thunderstorm on 25 April 1969, the other on 6 September 1969, in a landing accident. Four Thai civilians on the ground were also killed in the second crash.\nBatcat EC-121s were camouflaged in the standard three-color Southeast Asia scheme while the College Eye/Disco early warning aircraft were not. BatCat missions were 18 hours in length, with eight hours on station at one of 11 color-coded orbits used during their five-year history, three of which were over South Vietnam, six over Laos, one over Cambodia, and one over the Gulf of Tonkin.\nEC-121Rs were operated by the 553d and 554th Reconnaissance Squadrons of the 553d Reconnaissance Wing, between 19 October 1967 and 15 December 1970, with approximately 20 Batcats on hand at any one time. The Wing was inactivated 15 December 1970, and the 554th RS relocated to Nakhon Phanom RTAFB to fly QU-22 sensor monitors nicknamed \"Baby Bats\". Initially with 11 aircraft, the 553rd RS continued operations for another year, gradually returning aircraft and crews to the United States. The final Batcat mission was flown 5 December 1971.

(60, 'Project Magnet', 'Project Magnet was an unidentified flying object (UFO) study programme established by Transport Canada on in December 1950 under the direction of Wilbert Brockhouse Smith, senior radio engineer for Transport Canada\'s Broadcast and Measurements Section. It was formally active until mid-1954 and informally active (without government funding) until Smith\'s death in 1962. Smith eventually concluded that UFOs were probably extraterrestrial in origin and likely operated by manipulation of magnetism.\n\n\n== History ==\nSmith made a request to use the facilities of the Department of Transport to study UFOs. The project was formally approved on December 2, 1950 with the intention to collect data about UFOs and apply any recovered data to practical engineering and technology. The ultimate goal of the project was to apply any findings on the subject of geomagnetism to the possibility of exploiting Earth\'s magnetic field as a source of propulsion for vehicles. Smith and his colleagues in government believed that UFOs, if real, might hold the key to this new source of power. A small-scale undertaking, the project used DOT facilities, with some assistance from personnel at the Defence Research Board (DRB) and the National Research Council. In June 1952 Smith issued a preliminary report arguing that UFOs likely came from intelligent, extraterrestrial sources and almost certainly manipulated magnetism for flight. A 1953 report reiterated these conclusions. Also in April 1952 the Canadian government established Project Second Storey, a parallel UFO research project, with Smith also involved.  It consisted of a group of scientists and military officers who met periodically to consider the UFO question and to recommend government action. Smith reported to Second Storey on some of Project Magnet\'s findings and conclusions.Smith believed UFOs were linked to psychic phenomena  and believed himself to be in contact with extraterrestrial beings who communicated to him through telepathy. Smith wrote a number of articles for Topside, the publication of the Ottawa New Sciences Club which he founded, outlining the philosophy of the \"Space Brothers\" with whom he claimed to be in contact. The articles were later collected and published posthumously in 1969 under the title The Boys from Topside.\n\n\n== Shirley\'s Bay ==\nIn October 1952, Smith set up an observatory at Shirley\'s Bay outside Ottawa to study reports of UFO sightings, believing that UFOs would emit physical characteristics that could be measured. A number of sighting reports were investigated by Project Magnet but in 1954 the project was shut down. Smith was allowed to use the Shirley\'s Bay facilities with his own funding and did so until his death in 1962.\n\n\n== Footnotes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nClark, Jerome, The UFO Encyclopedia: The Phenomenon from the Beginning, Volume 2, L-Z Detroit: Omnigraphics, 1998 (2nd edition, 2005), ISBN 0-7808-0097-4\nStory, Ronald J.

(62, 'Gemini 4', 'Gemini 4 (officially Gemini IV) was the second manned space flight in NASA\'s Project Gemini, occurring in June 1965. It was the tenth manned American spaceflight (including two X-15 flights at altitudes exceeding 100 kilometers (54 nmi)). Astronauts James McDivitt and Ed White circled the Earth 66 times in four days, making it the first US flight to approach the five-day flight of the Soviet Vostok 5. The highlight of the mission was the first space walk by an American, during which White floated free outside the spacecraft, tethered to it, for approximately 20 minutes. Both of these accomplishments helped the United States overcome the Soviet Union\'s early lead in the Space Race.\nThe flight also included the first attempt to make a space rendezvous as McDivitt attempted to maneuver his craft close to the Titan II upper stage which launched it into orbit, but this was not successful.\nThe flight was the first American flight to perform many scientific experiments in space, including use of a sextant to investigate the use of celestial navigation for lunar flight in the Apollo program.\n\n\n== Crew ==\n\n\n=== Backup crew ===\n\n\n=== Support crew ===\nVirgil I. \"Gus\" Grissom (Houston CAPCOM)\nRoger B.

The four-day, 66-orbit flight would approach but not break the five-day record set by the Soviet Vostok 5 in June 1963.  Subsequent Gemini flights would be longer, to prove endurance exceeding the time required to fly to the Moon and back.\nA second objective was the first American extra-vehicular activity (EVA), known popularly as a \"space walk\". The first space walk had already been performed by Soviet Alexei Leonov on Voskhod 2 in March 1965. NASA moved up the spacewalk from the original schedule, to demonstrate that the US was gaining on the early lead taken by the Soviets in what was known as the Space Race. As late as 11 days before the scheduled June 3 launch, newspapers were reporting that NASA was saying it \"had not yet determined whether White would be the first American astronaut to expose himself to the elements of space,\" and that \"A decision might not be made until a day or two before launching.\" A third objective was for Gemini 4 to attempt the first space rendezvous, flying in formation with the spent second stage of its Titan II launch vehicle.\n\n\n== Flight ==\n\n\n=== Launch ===\n\nLaunched from LC-19 at Cape Kennedy Air Force Station, Florida, Gemini 4 was the first flight to be controlled by the new Mission Control Center at the Manned Spacecraft Center in Houston, Texas, which had to conduct three-shift operations due to the flight\'s long duration.The broadcast of the launch was itself historic. For the first time an international audience, from 12 European nations, could watch the lift-off on live television via the Early Bird satellite. Press interest, due to the satellite broadcast and the new center in Houston, proved to be so high that NASA had to lease buildings to accommodate the 1,100 print and broadcast journalists who requested accreditation. Flight control shifted from Cape Kennedy to Houston as soon as the vehicle cleared the launch tower.\nAt liftoff, two roll transients caused by misalignment of the Titan first stage engines occurred; these were quickly corrected by the autopilot. The fuel top-off umbilical failed to detach and was pulled loose when the booster had climbed about 27 feet (8 meters). A small oscillation in the pitch and yaw planes resulted from this. Performance of all launch vehicle systems was nearly nominal. Some modifications had been made to the guidance program on Gemini 4\'s booster to produce a less lofted flight trajectory and a lower altitude at BECO than on Gemini 3, these were generally successful despite a still somewhat lofted flight path. BECO was affected at T+152 seconds and SECO at T+333 seconds. The spacecraft entered into an 87-by-153-nautical-mile (161 by 283 km) orbit.\n\n\n=== Rendezvous attempt ===\nOn the first orbit, McDivitt attempted to rendezvous with the spent Titan second stage. This was unsuccessful for a number of reasons:\n\nNASA engineers had not yet worked out the idiosyncrasies of orbital mechanics involved in rendezvous, which are counter-intuitive. Simply thrusting the spacecraft toward the target changed its orbital altitude and velocity relative to the target. When McDivitt tried this, he found himself moving away and downward, as the retrograde thrust lowered his orbit, increasing his speed.\nThe stage was dumping its residual propellant, causing it to move around in various directions relative to the Gemini.\nThere were only two running lights on the stage, which made it hard at times for McDivitt to determine its orientation. McDivitt concluded that a rendezvous target should have at least three lights.\nThere was no radar on board Gemini 4 to give a precise range to the target, so the astronauts had to rely on their visual depth perception to estimate the range, and this differed for the two men.  Initially McDivitt estimated the distance at 400–500 feet (120–150 m), while White believed it was closer (\"a little over 200 feet (61 m)\"). At the worst point, McDivitt estimated it was about a half mile (800 meters) away, while White\'s estimate was three-quarters of a mile (1200 meters). McDivitt estimated he was able to get as close as 200 feet (61 m), but now White\'s estimate was between 850 and 1,000 feet (260 and 300 m).After expending almost half his thruster fuel, McDivitt finally gave up, in order to concentrate on the more important EVA objective. (Rendezvous was finally achieved successfully by Wally Schirra commanding Gemini 6A in December.) After the rendezvous, Gemini 4\'s orbit was now 89.2 by 155 nautical miles (165.2 by 287.1 km). Twenty-two hours into the mission, Mission Control estimated the orbit would decay to 81 by 125.7 nautical miles (150.0 by 232.8 km) at the end of 63 revolutions.\n\n\n=== Extra-vehicular activity (EVA) ===\n\nOriginally planned for the second revolution, the astronauts postponed the EVA until the third after McDivitt decided that White, following the stress of the launch and the failed rendezvous, looked tired and hot. After a rest, the pair finished performing the checklist for the EVA. Flying over Carnarvon, Australia, they began to depressurize the cabin. Over Hawaii, White pulled the handle to open his hatch, but the latches failed to move.\nFortunately, McDivitt knew what the problem was, because the hatch had failed to close in a vacuum chamber test on the ground, after which McDivitt worked with a technician to see what the cause was. A spring, which forced gears to engage in the mechanism, had failed to compress, and McDivitt got to see how the mechanism worked. In flight, he was able to help White get it open, and thought he could get it to latch again.There were communication problems during the spacewalk. Gemini spacecraft were the first to use a voice-operated switch (known as VOX) on the astronaut\'s microphones, but McDivitt soon realized his VOX circuit wasn\'t working properly; he could only hear the Capsule Communicator (CAPCOM) in the push-to-talk setting, but not on VOX (though both astronauts could be heard by each other and the ground.) Plus, while outside the spacecraft, White was unable to receive transmissions from the ground and had to have all messages relayed through McDivitt. McDivitt must have switched to the VOX setting somewhere around the time White was exiting the spacecraft, because at that point, for most of the EVA, neither he nor White responded either to the Hawaii CAPCOM, or to the Houston CAPCOM, Gus Grissom. Grissom tried to talk to Gemini 4 a total of 40 times in 13 minutes before he got a response.Tied to a tether, White floated out of the spacecraft, using a Hand-Held Maneuvering Unit (informally called a \"zip gun\") which expelled pressurized oxygen to provide thrust for controlling his travel. He went fifteen feet (five meters) out, and began to experiment with maneuvering. He found it easy, especially the pitch and yaw, although he thought the roll would use too much gas. He maneuvered around the spacecraft while McDivitt took photographs. White enjoyed the experience, but exhausted the HHMU gas sooner than he would have liked.\nWhite was running up against two factors which constrained the time for his EVA: loss of signal from the Bermuda tracking station, and crossing the solar terminator. The flight controllers were becoming increasingly frustrated with their inability to remind White of the time constraint, because they didn\'t want the first EVA to be performed in darkness, or out of communication with Earth. Finally McDivitt decided to take his microphone off of VOX:\n\nMcDivitt, to White: I\'m going out to PUSH-TO-TALK and see what the Flight Director has got to say.Flight Director Chris Kraft, to Grissom: The flight director says, get back in! (Kraft was not on the air-to-ground loop with the astronauts.)McDivitt: Gus, this is Jim. Got any message for us?Grissom: Gemini 4, get back in!McDivitt: Okay. ... (to White): ... They want you to come back in now.White tried to use taking more pictures as an excuse to stay out longer, and McDivitt had to coax him in. He finally came back in after a total of approximately 20 minutes. He said, \"It\'s the saddest moment of my life.\" By the time he got in, the spacecraft had entered darkness.The hatch proved to be as stubborn to relatch as it was to open. This would have been disastrous, resulting in both men\'s deaths on reentry. But McDivitt was able to fix the mechanism once again, so White could close it. The mission plan called for opening the hatch again to throw out White\'s now-unnecessary EVA equipment, but McDivitt elected not to do this, instead keeping the unnecessary equipment on board for the rest of the flight.They powered down the spacecraft\'s maneuvering system, intending to drift for the next two-and-a-half days to conserve the remaining fuel. They also intended to sleep alternate four-hour periods, but this turned out to be extremely difficult with the constant radio communications and the small cabin, about the size of the front seats of a compact car.\nWhite\'s 20-minute space walk was the mission\'s highlight, with McDivitt\'s photographs being published worldwide. These also showed White wearing an Omega \'Speedmaster\' chronograph watch on his spacesuit sleeve, one of two makes which had been approved by NASA for space use following extensive tests.  Omega were unaware of these tests or the fact that their product was going to be used in space, until they saw McDivitt\'s photos.  The model worn during the spacewalk is now known as the \"Ed White\" by watch collectors.\n\n\n=== Experiments ===\nEleven experiments were carried on the spacecraft:\n\nExperiment D-8 used five dosimeters to measure the radiation in the spacecraft environment. Of particular interest was the South Atlantic Anomaly.\nExperiment D-9 was an experiment in simple spacecraft navigation where the crew used a sextant to measure their position using the stars. The objective was to investigate the feasibility of using this technique for lunar flights on the Apollo program.\nExperiments S-5 and S-6 were both photography experiments where they used a 70-millimeter Hasselblad camera to photograph the weather and terrain below them.\nThere were two medical experiments: M-3 and M-4. The first was a bungee cord that the crew used for exercise. They said, after the mission, that this got harder as the mission went on, though this may have been due to a lack of sleep. The second was the phonocardiogram experiment, which had sensors attached to their bodies that measured heartbeat rates, especially during liftoff, EVA, and reentry.There were four engineering experiments:\n\nMSC-1 measured the electrostatic charge in the spacecraft,\nMSC-2 was a proton-electron spectrometer,\nMSC-3 was a tri-axis magnetometer and\nMSC-10 involved the crew photographing the red-blue Earth limb.Photographs were taken over the Middle East and the southwestern United States; several air fields indicated on charts were identified.\nThe crew had 16 freeze-dried meals and ate all but one of them. As they lacked any means of measuring water intake, they attempted to minimize consumption of it and also reported high amounts of gas bubbles in the water from the water dispenser. They experienced a degree of eye, nose, and throat irritation early in the flight and post-landing, this was attributed to ammonia fumes from the flame retardant used in the cabin, which was changed to a different material on subsequent flights.\n\n\n=== Reentry ===\n\nThe computer failed on the 48th revolution. This was unfortunate for IBM which had just put an advertisement in the Wall Street Journal saying that its computers were so reliable that even NASA used them. The computer failure meant that the capsule would not be able to perform a closed-loop lifting reentry as planned.\nReentry came on the 62nd revolution. An open-loop rolling reentry (as used in Mercury) had to be used because of the computer failure. The astronauts began rolling the spacecraft at 65 nautical miles (120 km) altitude to increase its stability. They started slowing the roll rate at 89,000 feet (27 km) and stopped it by 39,000 feet (12 km). The drogue parachute deployed shortly after this, and the main deployed at 10,600 feet (3.2 km). A malfunctioning thruster caused the roll to be much faster than planned, and the landing was rough. Neither of the crew encountered any problems, however, contrary to NASA doctors\' concerns about their landing upright — as opposed to on their backs, as in Mercury — after four days in space. Even though they landed 43 nautical miles (80 km) short of the intended landing target, some ships had already started steaming to the touchdown point and a helicopter was able to see them land. The prime recovery ship was USS Wasp. The recovery was supported by 10,249 U.S. Department of Defense personnel, 134 aircraft, and 26 ships.\nPostflight medical examination found the astronauts to be in good health and no significant physiological changes were found.\n\n\n== Insignia ==\n\nGemini 4\'s crew originally intended to call their spacecraft American Eagle, but this was rejected after NASA management issued a memo saying that they did not want a repeat performance of the previous mission, on which Gus Grissom had named his spacecraft Molly Brown.The callsign for the mission became simply Gemini 4. There was no patch flown on the crew\'s suits, although the one shown here, created after the fact, is on display in McDivitt\'s museum. Since McDivitt and White were prohibited from naming their spacecraft, they decided to put the American flag on their suits, the first astronauts to do so, although Soviet crews wore the Cyrillic \"СССР\" on their spacesuit helmets. Previous astronauts had only had the NASA insignia and a strip with their name on their suits.\nThe flight was commemorated on a pair of US postage stamps in 1967.\n\n\n== Spacecraft location ==\n\nThe spacecraft is on permanent display at the National Air and Space Museum, Washington, D.C.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nExtra-vehicular activity\nList of spacewalks\nSplashdown\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates public domain material from websites or documents of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nCollins, Michael (2009).

(63, 'Mariana UFO incident', 'The Mariana UFO Incident occurred in August 1950 in Great Falls, Montana. The film footage of the sighting is believed to be among the first ever taken of what came to be called an unidentified flying object, and was investigated by the U.S. Air Force.\n\n\n== The incident ==\n\nAt 11:25 am on August 15, 1950, Nick Mariana, the general manager of the Great Falls Electrics minor-league baseball team, and his nineteen-year-old secretary, Virginia Raunig, were inspecting the empty Legion Stadium baseball field before a game. The Electrics were a farm club of the Brooklyn Dodgers. A bright flash caught Mariana\'s eye and, according to his reports, he saw two bright silvery objects, rotating while flying over Great Falls at a speed he estimated to be two hundred to four hundred miles per hour. He believed that they were roughly fifty feet wide and one hundred and fifty feet apart. Mariana ran to his car to retrieve his 16 mm movie camera and filmed the UFOs for sixteen seconds. The camera could film the objects in color, but could not record sound. Raunig also witnessed the objects. The day after Mariana\'s sighting, the Great Falls Tribune, the city\'s daily newspaper, described his sighting and the film in an article, which was picked up by other media outlets around the nation. For several weeks after the sighting, Mariana showed his film to local community groups, including the Central Roundtable Athletic Club.\n\n\n== Air Force investigation ==\nAfter seeing the film, a reporter for the Great Falls Tribune called Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio and informed them of Mariana\'s sighting and film. U.S. Air Force Captain John P. Brynildsen interviewed Mariana at nearby Malmstrom AFB outside of Great Falls. When Mariana and Ms. Raunig both told him that they had seen two jet fighters pass over the baseball stadium shortly after the sighting, Brynildsen felt that perhaps the jets were the objects Mariana had seen and captured on film. With Mariana\'s permission, Capt. Brynildsen sent the film to Wright-Patterson AFB for analysis. He told a reporter in Great Falls that he had \"picked up about eight feet of film from Mariana.\" However, in his message to Wright-Patterson he said that he was sending \"approximately fifteen feet of moving picture film\" to the base for study.  According to UFO historian Jerome Clark, this discrepancy was never cleared up.At Wright-Patterson AFB the film was briefly examined and determined to be the reflections from two F-94 jet fighters that were known to be flying over Great Falls at the time of Mariana\'s sighting. Lt. Col. Ray W. Taylor returned the film to Mariana with a cover letter stating that \"our photoanalysts were unable to find anything identifiable of an unusual nature\". However, according to Air Force officer Edward J. Ruppelt, who would become the supervisor of the Air Force\'s Project Blue Book investigation into the UFO mystery in 1951, \"in 1950 there was no interest [by the Air Force] in the UFO, so after a quick viewing, Project Grudge had written them off as the reflections from two F-94 jet fighters that were in the area\". Controversy soon arose when Mariana claimed that the first thirty-five frames of his film - which he said most clearly showed the UFOs as rotating disks - were missing. People in the Great Falls area who had viewed Mariana\'s film supported his claims. They claimed that the missing frames clearly showed the UFOs as spinning, metallic disks with a \"notch or band\" along their outer edges. The Air Force personnel denied this accusation, and insisted that they had removed only a single frame of film which was damaged in the analysis.\n\n\n== Lawsuit ==\nIn January 1951, Bob Considine, a writer and UFO skeptic, wrote an article for Cosmopolitan magazine. Entitled \"The Disgraceful Flying Saucer Hoax\", it debunked the most famous UFO sightings to that date, including Mariana\'s sighting and film. Claiming that Considine\'s article implied that he was \"a liar, prankster, half-wit, crank, publicity hound and fanatic\", Mariana filed a lawsuit for slander against Considine. The lawsuit was eventually dropped in September 1955.\n\n\n== Later studies ==\nIn July 1952, Captain Ruppelt was able to convince Mariana to let the Air Force see the film again for a more detailed analysis. Mariana reluctantly agreed, but only after requiring the Air Force to sign an agreement that they would not remove any frames of the film. The film analysts at Wright-Patterson AFB concluded that the objects in Mariana\'s film were not \"birds, balloons, or meteors\". The original conclusion - that the objects were reflections from the F-94 jets - was also ruled out. According to Ruppelt in his memoirs: \"The two jets weren\'t anywhere close to where the two UFOs had been... we studied each individual light and both appeared too steady to be reflections. We drew a blank on the Montana Movie, it was an unknown\". In January 1953 the Air Force and CIA convened a committee of prominent scientists to examine the \"best\" cases collected by Project Blue Book. Called the Robertson Panel, after its chairman, physicist H.P. Robertson, it viewed Mariana\'s UFO film. The scientists judged that the objects in the film were \"reflections of aircraft known to have been in the area\".\n\n\n== Baker analysis ==\nIn 1954 Greene-Rouse productions decided to film a documentary-movie about the UFO phenomenon. They asked Nick Mariana for the rights to use his film in the documentary, and Mariana agreed. To analyze the film, they hired Robert M.L. Baker, Jr., a scientist and engineer for the Douglas Aircraft company. Baker completed his analysis of Mariana\'s film in early 1956. He concluded that the explanation that the objects were simply reflections from the F-94 jets was \"quite strained\".In 1968 Baker testified before a Congressional hearing on UFOs. He commented on his analysis of the Mariana film: \"Preliminary analysis excluded most natural phenomena. More detailed study indicated that the only remaining natural phenomenon candidate for the Utah film was birds in flight, and for the Montana film it was airplane fuselage reflections of the sun. After about 18 months of rather detailed, albeit not continuous, study using various film-measuring equipments [sic] at Douglas and at UCLA, as well as analysis of a photogrammetric experiment, it appeared that neither of these hypothesized natural phenomena explanations had merit\".In 1969 Baker presented a paper at the AAAS UFO panel organized by Thornton Page and Carl Sagan. He discussed the Mariana film as well as other films and photographs of UFOs. Baker concluded that the Mariana film was unidentifiable. He emphasized the importance of improving the quality of photographic data before speculating about the nature of UFOs.\n\n\n== Condon report ==\nIn 1966 the U.S. government established and funded a study of the UFO phenomenon. Located at the University of Colorado at Boulder, and chaired by Dr. Edward U. Condon, a prominent physicist, the committee\'s researchers decided to \"reinvestigate\" Mariana\'s UFO film. The Condon Committee assigned two investigators to study the case: Dr. Roy Craig, a physicist who was generally skeptical of UFOs, and Dr. David Saunders, a psychologist who had long been interested in the Mariana UFO incident.\nSaunders and Craig soon added a new problem to the case - they were not sure whether the film had been taken on August 5 or August 15, 1950. After interviewing Mariana, the two researchers came to different conclusions about the film. Craig remained skeptical of Mariana\'s claims that 35 frames had been removed from the footage: \"the comment I considered most significant, which Mr. Mariana\'s ex-secretary made to me during a telephone interview...when I pressed for information or beliefs regarding clipping of the film by the Air Force. The very hesitant comment was, \'What you have to remember in all this is... that Nick Mariana is a promoter\'. That comment was adequate to close our conversation\". In his memoirs, Dr. Craig also wrote that: \"I would not like to have to defend Dr. Saunders\'s conviction that the Mariana film is strong evidence that we have extraterrestrial visitors\". However, David Saunders thought the Mariana film was a crucial case in the Colorado Project\'s case files. Impressed by Baker\'s analysis, Saunders was suspicious of the discrepancy over the missing frames at the beginning of the Mariana film. He was particularly concerned with reports that the first three seconds of the film that were missing clearly indicated the objects were spinning discs. He came to the conclusion that Mariana\'s film \"was the one sighting of all time that did more than any other single case to convince me that there is something to the UFO problem\".Dr. William Hartmann, an astronomer for the University of Arizona, analyzed the Mariana UFO film for the Condon Report. His conclusion was that \"past investigations have left airplanes as the principal working hypothesis. The data at hand indicate that while it strains credibility to suppose that these were airplanes, the possibility nonetheless cannot be entirely ruled out. There are several independent arguments against airplane reflections.\".\n\n\n== Today ==\nCopies of Mariana\'s film currently reside in the US National Archives. It is still featured in documentaries, television programs, and shared online.  The film continues to be debated. Since Mariana\'s sighting, over 100 other UFO sightings have been made in Great Falls, Montana, making it one of the most active locations for UFO sightings in North America. In 2008, the minor-league baseball team in Great Falls was renamed the Great Falls Voyagers in honor of the Mariana UFO incident.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of UFO sightings\nUFO\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===\n\n\n== External links ==\nGREAT FALLS, MONTANA, 08/15/1950 film at the National Archives\nLocation: Great Falls, Mont. - Date: August 1950 - Incident Number: [BLANK] - archives.gov\nProject Blue Book case file.

(64, 'Pascagoula Abduction', 'The Pascagoula Abduction is an alleged UFO sighting and alien abduction to have occurred in 1973 when co-workers Charles Hickson and Calvin Parker claimed they were abducted by aliens while fishing near Pascagoula, Mississippi. The incident earned substantial mass media attention.\n\n\n== Alleged abduction ==\nOn the evening of October 11, 1973, co-workers 42-year-old Charles Hickson and 19-year-old Calvin Parker told the Jackson County, Mississippi Sheriff\'s office they were fishing off a pier on the west bank of the Pascagoula River in Mississippi when they heard a whirring/whizzing sound, saw two flashing blue lights and an oval shaped object 30–40 feet across and 8–10 feet high. Parker and Hickson claimed that they were \"conscious but paralyzed\" while three \"creatures\" took them aboard the object and subjected them to an examination before releasing them.\n\n\n== Publicity ==\nWithin days, Pascagoula was the center of an international news story, with reporters swarming the town. UFOlogists James Harder of the Aerial Phenomena Research Organization and J. Allen Hynek interviewed the two men. Harder attempted to hypnotize them and concluded Hickson and Parker \"experienced an extraterrestrial phenomena\", while Hynek believed they had \"a very real, frightening experience\". Hickson later appeared on talk shows, gave lectures and interviews, and in 1983 authored a self-published book UFO Contact at Pascagoula. Hickson claimed additional encounters with aliens in 1974, alleging that the aliens told him they were \"peaceful\". Parker later attended UFO conventions and in 1993 started a company called \"UFO Investigations\" to produce television stories about UFOs. Charles Hickson died of a heart attack at age 80 on September 9, 2011.\n\n\n== Skepticism ==\nAviation journalist and UFO skeptic Philip J. Klass found \"discrepancies\" in Hickson\'s story. When Hickson took a polygraph exam, the examiner determined that Hickson believed the abduction story, but Klass argued that the test was administered by an \"inexperienced\" operator and that Hickson refused to take another by a more experienced police operator. Klass concluded the case was a hoax based on these and other discrepancies. Skeptical investigator Joe Nickell wrote that Hickson\'s behavior was \"questionable\" and that he altered or embellished his story when later appearing on television shows. Nickell speculated that Hickson may have fantasized the encounter with aliens during a hypnagogic \"waking dream state\", adding that Parker\'s corroboration of the tale was likely due to suggestibility, since he told police he had \"passed out at the beginning of the incident and failed to regain consciousness until it was over\".\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of UFO sightings\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAll They Meant To Do Was Go Fishing (NICAP transcript of an interview with Hickson and Parker)', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/57/Mississippi-Coast-towns-NOAA.jpg'),
(65, 'Men in Black', 'In popular culture and UFO conspiracy theories, men in black (MIB) are supposed men dressed in black suits who claim to be quasi-government agents who harass or threaten UFO witnesses to keep them quiet about what they have seen. It is sometimes implied that they may be aliens themselves. The term is also frequently used to describe mysterious men working for unknown organizations, as well as various branches of government allegedly designed to protect secrets or perform other strange activities. The term is generic, used for any unusual, threatening or strangely behaved individual whose appearance on the scene can be linked in some fashion with a UFO sighting. Several alleged encounters with the men in black have been reported by UFO researchers and enthusiasts.\nStories about allegedly real-life men in black inspired the semi-comic science fiction Men in Black franchise of comic books, films, and other media.\n\n\n== Folklore ==\nFolklorist James R. Lewis compares accounts of men in black with  tales of people encountering Lucifer and speculates that they can be considered a kind of \"psychological drama\".\n\n\n== Ufologists ==\nMen in black figure prominently in ufology and UFO folklore. In the 1950s and 1960s, UFOlogists adopted a conspiratorial mindset and began to fear they would be subject to organized intimidation in retaliation for discovering \"the truth of the UFOs\".In 1947, Harold Dahl claimed to have been warned not to talk about his alleged UFO sighting on Maury Island by a man in a dark suit. In the mid-1950s, the ufologist Albert K. Bender claimed he was visited by men in dark suits who threatened and warned him not to continue investigating UFOs. Bender maintained that the men in black were secret government agents who had been given the task of suppressing evidence of UFOs. The ufologist John Keel claimed to have had encounters with men in black and referred to them as \"demonic supernaturals\" with \"dark skin and/or ‘exotic’ facial features\". According to the ufologist Jerome Clark, reports of men in black represent \"experiences\" that \"don\'t seem to have occurred in the world of consensus reality\".Historian Aaron Gulyas wrote, \"during the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, UFO conspiracy theorists would incorporate the Men in Black into their increasingly complex and paranoid visions\".In his article, \"Gray Barker: My Friend, the Myth-Maker,\" John C. Sherwood claims that, in the late 1960s, at the age of 18, he cooperated when Gray Barker urged him to develop a hoax—which Barker subsequently published—about what Barker called \"blackmen\", three mysterious UFO inhabitants who silenced Sherwood\'s pseudonymous identity, \"Dr. Richard H.

(67, 'Grey alien', 'Grey aliens, also referred to as Zeta Reticulans, Roswell Greys, or Grays, are purported extraterrestrial beings whose existence is discussed in ufological, paranormal, and New Age communities and who are named for their unique skin color. Forty-three percent of all reported alien encounters in the United States describe Grey aliens. Such claims vary in every respect, including the nature, origins (e.g. extraterrestrials, extradimensionals, time travelers, or machines), moral dispositions, intentions, and physical appearances of the encountered beings, though many of them nonetheless share some noticeable similarities. A composite description derived from this overlap would have Greys as small-bodied beings with smooth grey-colored skin, enlarged hairless heads and large black eyes.\nThe popularization of the idea of the Grey alien is commonly associated with the Barney and Betty Hill abduction claim, which purportedly took place in New Hampshire in 1961, although skeptics see precursors in science fiction and earlier paranormal claims; Grey aliens are also famed from earlier depictions of the 1947 Roswell UFO incident. Some sources in the UFO community describe the Grey aliens as artificially created/modified race used by other alien races as servants or even slaves to execute tasks such as abductions and others. Whatever the origin, the Grey alien has since emerged as an archetypal image of sentient non-human creatures and extraterrestrial life in general, as well as an iconic trope of popular culture in the age of space exploration.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\nGreys are typically depicted as dark grey-skinned diminutive humanoid beings that possess reduced forms of, or completely lack, external human organs such as noses, ears or sex organs. Their bodies are usually depicted as being elongated, having a small chest, and lacking in muscular definition and visible skeletal structure. Their legs are shorter and jointed differently from what one would expect in a human. Their limbs are often depicted as proportionally different from a human\'s; their humerus and thighs are the same lengths as their forearms and shins.Greys are depicted as having unusually large heads in proportion to their bodies. They are depicted as having no hair anywhere on the body, including the face, and no noticeable outer ears or noses, but only small openings or orifices for ears and nostrils. They are generally depicted as having very small mouths and very large opaque black eyes with no discernible iris or pupil. Reports of alleged encounters frequently state their height to be 2–4 feet (0.61–1.22 m) tall, although other varieties of Greys are sometimes portrayed as human-sized or taller.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\n\n\n=== History ===\nThe precise origin of the Grey as the stereotypical extraterrestrial being is difficult to pinpoint. In the 1893 article \"Man of the Year Million\", science fiction author H.G. Wells envisioned the possibility of humanity transformed into a race of grey-skinned beings who were perhaps one meter tall, with big heads and large, oval-shaped pitch-black eyes. In his 1901 book The First Men in the Moon, Wells described Selenites (natives of the Moon) as having grey skin, big heads, and large black eyes. He also briefly describes aliens resembling Greys brought down to Earth as food for the Martians, who were the antagonist characters in his 1898 novel The War of the Worlds.\nIn 1933, the Swedish novelist Gustav Sandgren, using the pen name Gabriel Linde, published a science fiction novel called Den okända faran (\"The Unknown Danger\"), in which he describes a race of extraterrestrials: \"...the creatures did not resemble any race of humans. They were short, shorter than the average Japanese, and their heads were big and bald, with strong, square foreheads, and very small noses and mouths, and weak chins. What was most extraordinary about them were the eyes—large, dark, gleaming, with a sharp gaze. They wore clothes made of soft grey fabric, and their limbs seemed to be similar to those of humans.\" The novel, aimed at young readers, included illustrations of the imagined aliens.\n\nIn 1965, newspaper reports of the Betty and Barney Hill abduction brought Greys to international attention. The alleged abductees, Betty and Barney Hill, claimed that in 1961, alien beings had abducted them and taken them to a flying saucer or saucer-shaped spaceship. (The term \"Greys\" did not come into usage until many years later, but the beings described by the Hills generally fit many characteristics of the Greys.) From a star chart reported by Betty Hill, Marjorie Fish, an elementary-school teacher and amateur astronomer, located the home planet of these beings in the Zeta Reticuli star system (allegedly the fourth planet of one of the stars of the Zeta Reticuli binary system). The Greys therefore became mistakenly known as Zeta Reticulans. However, the description of \"Zetans\", a similarly named alien race, differs completely from that of the \"Greys\", including in appearance, behaviour, flying craft design and their treatment of abductees.\nThe Greys appear as the (benevolent) aliens in the 1977 film Close Encounters of the Third Kind. That same year, a species of Grey alien–type beings, called the Bith, were depicted as the Cantina Band in the film Star Wars.\n\n\n=== 1980–1991 ===\n\nDuring the early 1980s, popular culture linked Greys to the alleged crash-landing of a flying saucer in Roswell, New Mexico in 1947. A number of publications contained statements from individuals who claimed to have seen the U.S. military handling a number of unusually proportioned, bald, child-sized beings. These individuals claimed that the beings had oversized heads and slanted eyes—but scant other facial features—during and after the incident.In 1987, novelist Whitley Strieber published the book Communion, which, unlike his previous works, was presented as non-fiction, and in which he describes a number of close encounters he alleges to have experienced with Greys and other extraterrestrial beings. The book became a New York Times bestseller, and New Line Cinema released a 1989 film adaption that starred Christopher Walken as Strieber.\nIn 1988 Christophe Dechavanne interviewed the French science-fiction writer and ufologist Jimmy Guieu during a weekly French TV Live Show which, at the time, was entitled \"Ciel, mon mardi !\". It was broadcast by TF1, one of the three national TV channels in France. Besides mentioning Majestic 12, Jimmy Guieu described the existence of what he called \"the little greys\" which, later on, became better known in French under the following name: les Petits-Gris.In the early 1990s, the same ufologist Jimmy Guieu wrote two docu-dramas, using as a plot the Grey aliens / Majestic-12 conspiracy as described by John Lear and Milton William Cooper: the series \"E.B.E.\" (for \"Extraterrestrial Biological Entity\"):  E.B.E.: Alerte rouge (first part) (1990) and E.B.E.: L\'entité noire d\'Andamooka (second part) (1991).\n\n\n=== 1992–present day ===\n\nDuring the 1990s, popular culture began to increasingly link Greys to a number of military-industrial complex and New World Order conspiracy theories. A well-known example of this was the FOX television series The X-Files, which first aired in 1993. It combined the quest to find proof of the existence of Grey-like extraterrestrials with a number of UFO conspiracy theory subplots, in order to form its primary story arc. Other notable examples include Dark Skies, first broadcast in 1996, which expanded upon the MJ-12 conspiracy, and Stargate SG-1, which in the 1998 episode \"Thor\'s Chariot\" introduced the Asgard, a race of benevolent Greys who visited ancient Earth masquerading as characters from Norse Mythology. Greys, referred to as \"visitors\", appear in two episodes of South Park, and Roger Smith, a regular character on the animated comedy series American Dad! since its debut in 2005, is a Grey-like alien. On Babylon 5, the Greys were referred to as the Vree, and depicted as being allies and trade partners of 23rd century Earth.\nIn 1995 filmmaker Ray Santilli claimed to have obtained 22 reels of 16 mm film that depicted the autopsy of a \"real\" Grey supposedly recovered from the site of the 1947 incident in Roswell, New Mexico. However, in 2006 Santilli announced that the film was not original, but was instead a \"reconstruction\" created after the original film was found to have degraded. He maintained that a real Grey had been found and autopsied on camera in 1947, and that the footage released to the public contained a percentage of that original footage, but he was unable to say what that percentage was. This incident became the subject of the 2006 British comedy film Alien Autopsy, starring television presenters Ant & Dec.During the 2000s, William J. Birnes published numerous accounts of encounters with little greys in UFO Magazine. \nThe 2011 film Paul tells the story of a Grey who attributes the Greys\' frequent presence in science-fiction pop-culture to the US government deliberately inserting the stereotypical Grey alien image into mainstream media so that if humanity came into contact with Paul\'s species, there would be no immediate shock as to their appearance.\nThe anime Dragon Ball Super also tells the story of Jiren the Grey, with the difference being that he is of muscular build. Jiren has repeatedly been stated to be the strongest foe Goku has ever faced, and that not even a God of Destruction can defeat him. His ki alone while suppressed was more than enough to shake the infinitely large World of Void, leaving all the Gods of Destruction in shock.\n\n\n== Analysis ==\n\n\n=== In close encounter claims and ufology ===\nGreys are commonly included in alien abduction claims. Among reports of supposed alien encounters, Greys make up approximately 50 percent in Australia, 43 percent in the United States, 90 percent in Canada, 67 percent in Brazil, 20 percent in Continental Europe, and around 12 percent in the United Kingdom. These reports include two distinct groups of Greys that differ in height. Abductees say that they recognize the leader of their abductors by its \"demeanor\". Some ufologists and abduction researchers believe that taller Greys, with their reported increased authority and apparently more complex psychology, may be the only Grey type to be biologically alive and that the shorter form could be their artificially constructed robot or cyborg servants.Some alien abduction reports have depicted variant skin colors such as blue-grey, green-grey, or purple-grey and sometimes not grey at all. The skin is typically described as being extremely smooth, almost as if made of an artificial material like rubber or plastic.Abduction claims are often described as extremely traumatic, similar to an abduction by humans or even a sexual assault in the level of trauma and distress. (Research has shown that emotional impact of perceived abduction can be as great as or even greater than that of combat, sexual abuse, and other traumatic events.)In his book Abduction, Dr. Paul recounts the events of David Hartman\'s abduction. Leading up to it Hartman, a computer programmer, claims he experienced strange phenomenon with his work tech including date and time changes, words typing by themselves, and whole sets of data moving from one place to another without human intervention. He also told of physical signs such as nausea, insomnia, and nightmares of inhuman faces coming out of the dark.\nThe eyes are often a focus of abduction claims. They are said to not move or focus in any observable way to the naked eye. Claims often describe a Grey staring into the eyes of an abductee when conducting mental procedures. This staring is claimed to induce hallucinogenic states or directly provoke different emotions. Although abduction claimants often say that the Grey was only inches from their face during the staring mindscan procedure, they often subsequently claim to not feeling breath or seeing the Grey\'s chest move from breathing.\n\n\n=== Psychocultural expression of intelligence ===\nNeurologist Dr. Steven Novella argues that the Grey idea is a byproduct of the human imagination, with the Greys\' most distinctive features representing everything that modern humans traditionally link with intelligence. \"The aliens, however, do not just appear as humans, they appear like humans with those traits we psychologically associate with intelligence.\"\n\n\n=== The \"Mother Hypothesis\" ===\nIn 2005, Frederick V. Malmstrom, writing in Skeptic magazine, vol. 11 issue 4, presents his hypothesis that Greys are actually residual memories of early childhood development. Malmstrom reconstructs the face of a Grey through transformation of a mother\'s face based on our best understanding of early childhood sensation and perception. Malmstrom\'s study offers a possible alternative to the existence of Greys, the intense instinctive response many people experience when presented an image of a Grey, and the ease of regression hypnosis and recovered-memory therapy in \"recovering\" memories of alien abduction experiences, along with their common themes. \n\n\n=== Evolutionary feasibility debate ===\n\nAccording to English reproductive biologist Jack Cohen, the typical image of a Grey, given that it would have evolved from a world with different environmental and ecological conditions from Earth, is too physiologically similar to a human to be credible as a representation of an alien. Their physical structure has been sometimes viewed as supporting the panspermia hypothesis, although the level of \"parallel evolution\" (using the term in as it is used in science fiction, distinct from the use in biology and the related term \"convergent evolution\") required is statistically next to nil. The \"parallel evolution\" concept is utilized as a plot device by Star Trek writers Gene Roddenberry and Gene Coon and referred to as \"Hodgkin\'s Law of Parallel Planet Development\".\nSome ufologists say such seemingly impossible coincidences show that extraterrestrial beings had some influence on the evolution of life on Earth in the distant past (the theory of ancient astronauts), specifically that extraterrestrials were directly involved in the evolution of primates, including humans. This was supposedly done by genetic engineering, cross-breeding, or a combination of both. This idea may have first gained widespread exposure with the 1968 publication of Chariots of the Gods? by Erich von Däniken and has since been the source of much controversy, inspiring numerous other books with various related theories.\nProponents of this theory of alien genetic-evolutionary intervention on Earth argue that if the Greys (or similar beings) were performing genetic manipulations with pre-human life forms on Earth that these aliens may have attempted to influence the evolution of life forms here in a direction consistent with their own genetic makeup, and similar to their own physiology and general physical structure, since genetically that is what they would presumably be most familiar with. Counter to this view, the anatomy, physiology, and genetic makeup of primates and humans are extremely similar to other animals on Earth, including those with divergent non-humanoid forms such as sea urchins, sea squirts, and acorn worms.Since the history of life on Earth gives some idea of what is and is not feasible on other worlds, and there is no conclusive evidence of any past extraterrestrial genetic manipulation in our own evolution, some ufologists have offered alternative explanations to accommodate for the evolutionary improbability of Greys (or any other bipedal, humanoid extraterrestrial species) by explaining them as being native hominids to Earth either having left or living in hiding, as Mac Tonnies proposed in his book The Cryptoterrestrials, or from another dimension, as proposed by John A. Keel and J. Allen Hynek.\n\n\n=== Conspiracy theories ===\nSome conspiracy theorists believe that Greys represent part of a government-led disinformation or plausible deniability campaign, or that they are a product of government mind control experiments. Dr. Steven Greer, founder of the Disclosure Project, and head of CSETI, claims to have over 400 \"government, military, and intelligence community witnesses\" that have offered testimony to the existence of aliens and UFOs or efforts to cover up their existence and who have stated that they would be willing to defend their claims under oath.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSkeptics Dictionary: Alien abduction', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c0/Greyalien.svg'),
(68, 'List of prizes for evidence of the paranormal', 'Paranormal challenges, often posed by groups or individuals who self-identify as skeptics or rationalists, publicly challenge those who claim to possess paranormal abilities to demonstrate that they in fact possess them, and are not fraudulent or self-deceptive.\n\n\n== Process ==\n\nAfter establishing procedures and measures of success agreed upon beforehand between the challengers and the claimants, a challenge is usually divided into two steps, the first being a \"preliminary test\" or \"pre-test\", where claimants can show their purported abilities under controlled conditions before a small audience, before being admitted to the final test. Sometimes these pre-tests have a smaller prize attached to them. Several local organisations have set up challenges that serve as pre-tests to larger prizes such as the JREF\'s One Million Dollar Paranormal Challenge or the 2012–2013 SKEPP Sisyphus Prize (for one million euros).\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1922, Scientific American made two US$2,500 offers: (1), for the first authentic spirit photograph made under test conditions, and (2), for the first psychic to produce a \"visible psychic manifestation.\" Harry Houdini was a member of the investigating committee. The first medium to be tested was George Valiantine, who claimed that in his presence spirits would speak through a trumpet that floated around a darkened room. For the test, Valiantine was placed in a room, the lights were extinguished, but unbeknownst to him his chair had been rigged to light a signal in an adjoining room if he left his seat. Because the light signals were tripped during his performance, Valiantine did not collect the award.Since then, many individuals and groups have offered similar monetary awards for proof of the paranormal in an observed setting. Indian rationalist Abraham Kovoor\'s challenge in 1963 inspired American skeptic James Randi\'s prize in 1964, which became the One Million Dollar Paranormal Challenge. In 2003, these prizes were calculated to have a combined value of US$2,326,500. As of  January 2015, none of the prizes have been awarded. The James Randi paranormal challenge was officially terminated in 2015. As of 2018, these prizes combine to approximately US$1,024,215. However, they take place in multiple countries and the conditions to be met may vary considerably.\n\n\n== List of standing prizes ==\n\n\n== List of defunct prizes ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nExploring Psychic Powers Live\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nChristopher, Milbourne (1975), Mediums, Mystics & the Occult.

(69, 'Mystery airship', 'Mystery airships or phantom airships are a class of unidentified flying objects best known from a series of newspaper reports originating in the western United States and spreading east during late 1896 and early 1897. According to researcher Jerome Clark, airship sightings were reported worldwide during the 1880s and 1890s. Mystery airship reports are seen as a cultural predecessor to modern claims of extraterrestrial-piloted flying saucer-style UFOs.  Typical airship reports involved night time sightings of unidentified lights, but more detailed accounts reported ships comparable to a dirigible. Reports of the alleged crewmen and pilots usually described them as human-looking, although sometimes the crew claimed to be from Mars.  It was popularly believed that the mystery airships were the product of some inventor or genius who was not ready to make knowledge of his creation public.  For example, Thomas Edison was so widely speculated to be the mind behind the alleged airships that in 1897 he \"was forced to issue a strongly worded statement\" denying his responsibility.It has been frequently argued that mystery airships are unlikely to represent test flights of real human-manufactured dirigibles as no record of successful sustained or long-range airship flights are known from the period and \"it would have been impossible, not to mention irrational, to keep such a thing secret.\"  To the contrary, however, there were in fact several functional airships manufactured before the 1896–97 reports (e.g., Solomon Andrews made successful test flights of his \"Aereon\" in 1863), but their capabilities were far more limited than the mystery airships. Reece and others note that contemporary American newspapers of the \"yellow journalism\" era were more likely to print manufactured stories and hoaxes than are modern news sources, and editors of the late 1800s often would have expected the reader to understand that such stories were false. Most journalists of the period did not seem to take the airship reports very seriously, as after the major 1896-97 wave concluded, the subject quickly fell from public consciousness. The airship stories received further attention only after the 1896-97 newspaper reports were largely rediscovered in the mid 1960s and UFO investigators suggested the airships might represent earlier precursors to post-World War II UFO sightings .\n\n\n== The airship wave of 1896-1897 ==\n\nThe best-known of the mystery airship waves began in California in 1896.  Afterwards, reports and accounts of similar airships came from other areas, generally moving eastward across the country.  Some accounts during this wave of airship reports claim that occupants were visible on some airships, and encounters with the pilots were reported as well.  These occupants often appeared to be human, though their behaviour, mannerisms and clothing were sometimes reported to be unusual.  Sometimes the apparent humans claimed to be from the planet Mars.Historian Mike Dash described and summarized the 1896–1897 series of airship sightings, writing:\n\nNot only were [the mystery airships] bigger, faster and more robust than anything then produced by the aviators of the world; they seemed to be able to fly enormous distances, and some were equipped with giant wings... The 1896–1897 airship wave is probably the best investigated of all historical anomalies. The files of almost 1,500 newspapers from across the United States have been combed for reports, an astonishing feat of research. The general conclusion of investigators was that a considerable number of the simpler sightings were misidentification of planets and stars, and a large number of the more complex the result of hoaxes and practical jokes. A small residuum remains [sic] perplexing.\n\n\n=== Specific cases ===\nThe Sacramento Bee and the San Francisco Call reported the first airship sighting on November 18, 1896. Witnesses reported a bright light moving slowly over Sacramento on the evening of November 17 at an estimated 1,000-foot elevation. Some witnesses said they could see a dark shape behind the light. A witness named R.L. Lowery reported that he heard a voice from the craft issuing commands to increase elevation in order to avoid hitting a church steeple. Lowery added \"in what was no doubt meant as a wink to the reader\" that he believed the apparent captain to be referring to the tower of a local brewery, as there were no churches nearby. Lowery further described the craft as being powered by two men exerting themselves on bicycle pedals. Above the pedaling men seemed to be a passenger compartment, which lay under the main body of the dirigible. A light was mounted on the front end of the airship. Some witnesses reported the sound of singing as the craft passed overhead.\nThe November 19, 1896, edition of the Stockton, California, Daily Mail featured one of the earliest accounts of an alleged alien craft sighting. Colonel H.G. Shaw claimed that while driving his buggy near Stockton, he came across what appeared to be a landed spacecraft. Shaw described it as having a metallic surface which was completely featureless apart from a rudder, and pointed ends. He estimated a diameter of 25 feet and said the vessel was around 150 feet in total length. Three slender, 7-foot-tall (2.1 m), apparent extraterrestrials were said to approach from the craft while \"emitting a strange warbling noise.\" The beings reportedly examined Shaw\'s buggy and then attempted to physically force him to accompany them back to the airship. The aliens were said to give up after realizing they lacked the physical strength to force Shaw aboard. They supposedly fled to their ship, which lifted off the ground and sped out of sight. Shaw believed that the beings were Martians sent to kidnap an earthling for unknowable but potentially nefarious purposes. This has been seen by some as an early attempt at alien abduction; it is apparently the first published account of explicitly extraterrestrial beings attempting to kidnap humans into their spacecraft.\nThe mystery light reappeared over Sacramento on the evening of November 21. It was also reportedly seen over Folsom, San Francisco, Oakland, Modesto, Turlock, Manteca,  Sebastopol and several other cities later that same evening and was reportedly viewed by hundreds of witnesses.\nOne witness from Arkansas – allegedly a former state senator Harris – was supposedly told by an airship pilot (during the tensions leading up to the Spanish–American War) that the craft was bound for Cuba, to use its \"Hotchkiss gun\" to \"kill Spaniards\".\nIn one account from Texas, three men reported an encounter with an airship and with \"five peculiarly dressed men\" who asserted that they were descendants of the lost tribes of Israel, and had learned English from the 1553 North Pole expedition led by Hugh Willoughby.\nOn February 2, 1897, the Omaha Bee reported an airship sighting over Hastings, Nebraska, the previous day.\nAn article in the Albion Weekly News reported that two witnesses saw an airship crash just inches from where they were standing. The airship suddenly disappeared, with a man standing where the vessel had been. The airship pilot showed the men a small device that supposedly enabled him to shrink the airship small enough to store the vessel in his pocket. A rival newspaper, the Wilsonville Review, playfully claimed that its own editor was an additional witness to the incident and that he heard the pilot say \"Weiver eht rof ebircsbus!\" The phrase he allegedly heard  is \"subscribe for the Review\" spelled backwards.\nOn April 10, 1897, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch published a story reporting that one W.H. Hopkins encountered a grounded airship about 20 feet in length and 8 feet in diameter near the outskirts of Springfield, Missouri. The vehicle was apparently propelled by three large propellers and crewed by a beautiful, nude woman and a bearded man, also nude. Hopkins attempted with some difficulty to communicate with the crew in order to ascertain their origins. Eventually they understood what Hopkins was asking of them and they both pointed to the sky and \"uttered something that sounded like the word Mars.\"\nAn April 16, 1897, a story published by the Table Rock Argus claimed that a group of \"anonymous but reliable\" witnesses had seen an airship sailing overhead. The craft had many passengers. The witnesses claimed that among these passengers was a woman tied to a chair, a woman attending her, and a man with a pistol guarding their apparent prisoner. Before the witnesses thought to contact the authorities, the airship was already gone.\nAn account from Aurora, Texas, related in the Dallas Morning News on April 19, 1897, reported that a couple of days before, an airship had smashed into a windmill – later determined to be a sump pump – belonging to a Judge Proctor, then crashed. The occupant was dead and mangled, but the story reported that the presumed pilot was clearly \"not an inhabitant of this world.\" Strange \"hieroglyphic\" figures were seen on the wreckage, which resembled \"a mixture of aluminum and silver ... it must have weighed several tons.\" In the 20th century, unusual metallic material recovered from the presumed crash site was shown to contain a percentage of aluminum and iron admixed. The story ended by noting that the pilot was given a \"Christian burial\" in the town cemetery.In 1973, MUFON investigators discovered the alleged stone marker used in this burial. Their metal detectors indicated a quantity of foreign material might remain buried there.  However, they were not permitted to exhume, and when they returned several years later, the headstone – and whatever metallic material had lain beneath it – was gone.\nAn account by Alexander Hamilton of Leroy, Kansas, supposedly occurred around April 19, 1897, and was published in the Yates Center Farmer\'s Advocate of April 23. Hamilton, his son and a tenant witnessed an airship hovering over his cattle pen. Upon closer examination, the witnesses realized that a red \"cable\" from the airship had lassoed a heifer, but had also become entangled in the pen\'s fence. After trying unsuccessfully to free the heifer, Hamilton cut loose a portion of the fence, then \"stood in amazement to see the ship, cow and all rise slowly and sail off.\" Some have suggested this was the earliest report of cattle mutilation. In 1982, however, UFO researcher Jerome Clark debunked this story, and confirmed via interviews and Hamilton\'s own affidavit that the story was a successful attempt to win a Liar\'s Club competition to create the most outlandish tall tale.\n\n\n== Other cases ==\n\n\n=== Before 1896 ===\nIn 1868, Charles Fort cited a mystery airship sighting in Copiapo, Chile. It was described as a gigantic, shining bird that driven by a noisy motor.In a variation of the usual airship, on July 29, 1880 two witnesses in Louisville, Kentucky saw a flying object described as \"a man surrounded by machinery which he seemed to be working with his hands\" with wings protruding from his back. Merely a month later, a similar sighting happened in New Jersey. It was written at the New York Times that \"it was apparently a man with bat\'s wings and improved frog\'s legs... the monster waved his wings in answer to the whistle of a locomotive.\"\n\n\n=== 1887 wave ===\nThere were a number of mystery airship reports from the East Coast of the U.S. in 1887.\n\n\n=== 1909–1913 ===\nThere was a series of mystery airship sightings in 1909 in New England, New Zealand and various European locations. Later reports came from the United Kingdom in 1912 and 1913. However, by this time airship technology was well advanced (Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin had been flying his massive passenger-carrying airships for nearly a decade by then), making the prospect that these may have been small, private airships rather than evidence of extraterrestrial visitation or newspaper hoaxes more reasonable.\nWallace Tillinghast, a Massachusetts businessman, gained notoriety for claims he was responsible for the 1909 wave due to an airship he had built, but his claims were never substantiated.\n\n\n== Later research ==\nJerome Clark writes, \"One curious feature of the post-1887 airship waves was the failure of each to stick in historical memory. Although 1909, for example, brought a flood of sightings worldwide and attendant discussion and speculation, contemporary accounts do not allude to the hugely publicized events of little more than a decade earlier.\"Clark writes that any attempt to \"uncover the truth about the late 19th-century airship scare comes up against some unhappy realities: newspaper coverage was unreliable; no independent investigators (\'airshipologists\') spoke directly with alleged witnesses or attempted to verify or debunk their testimony; and, with a single unsatisfactory exception, no eyewitness was ever interviewed even in the 1950s, when some were presumably still living.\"The \"single unsatisfactory exception\" Clark cites is a former San Francisco Chronicle employee interviewed via telephone by Edward J. Ruppelt in 1952. Ruppelt wrote that the man \"had been a copy boy…and remembered the incident, but time had cancelled out the details. He did tell me that he, the editor of the paper, and the news staff had seen \'the ship\', as he referred to the UFO. His story, even though it was fifty-six years old, smacked of others I\'d heard when he said that no one at the newspaper ever told anyone what they had seen; they didn\'t want people to think they were \'crazy\'.\"\nJacobs notes, \"Most arguments against the airship idea came from individuals who assumed that the witnesses did not see what they claimed to see. This is the crucial link between the 1896–97 phenomenon and the modern unidentified flying object phenomenon beginning in 1947. It also was central to the debate over whether unidentified flying objects constituted a unique phenomenon.\"In 2009, American author J. Allan Danelek wrote a book entitled The Great Airship of 1897 in which he made the case that the mystery airship was the work of an unknown individual, possibly funded by a wealthy investor from San Francisco, to build an airship prototype as a test vehicle for a later series of larger, passenger-carrying airships. In the work, Danelek demonstrates how the craft might have been built using materials and technologies available in 1896 (including speculative line drawings and technical details). The ship, Danelek proposes, was built in secret to safeguard its design from patent infringement as well as to protect investors in case of failure. Noting that the flights were initially seen over California and only later over the Midwest, he speculates that the inventor was making a series of short test flights, moving from west to east and following the main railway lines for logistical support, and that it was these experimental flights that formed the basis for many – though not all – of the newspaper accounts from the era. Danelek also notes that the reports ended abruptly in mid-April 1897, suggesting that the craft may have met with disaster, effectively ending the venture and permitting the sightings to fall into the realm of mythology.\n\n\n== Explanations ==\n\n\n=== Hoaxes or misidentification ===\nDuring the 1896–97 wave, there were many attempts to explain the airship sightings, including suggestions of hoaxes, pranks, publicity stunts and hallucinations.  One man suggested the airships were swarms of lightning beetles misidentified by observers.Jacobs believes that many airship tales originated with \"enterprising reporters perpetrating journalistic hoaxes.\" He notes that many of these accounts \"are easy to identify because of their tongue-in-cheek tone, and accent on the sensational.\" Furthermore, in many such newspaper hoaxes, the author makes his intent obvious \"by saying – in the last line – that he was writing from an insane asylum (or something to that effect).\"\n\n\n=== Human airships ===\nSome argued that the airship reports were genuine accounts.  Steerable airships had been publicly flown in the U.S. since the Aereon in 1863, and numerous inventors were working on airship and aircraft designs (the idea that a secretive inventor might have developed a viable craft with advanced capabilities was the focus of Jules Verne\'s 1886 novel Robur the Conqueror). In fact, two French Army officers and engineers, Arthur Krebs and Charles Renard, had successfully flown in an electric-powered airship called La France as early as 1885, making no fewer than seven successful flights in the craft over an eleven-month period. Also during the 1896–97 period, David Schwarz built an aluminum-skinned airship in Germany that successfully flew over Tempelhof Field before being irreparably damaged during a hard landing. Both events clearly demonstrated that the technology to build a practical airship existed during the period in question, though if reports of the capabilities of the California and Midwest airship sighted in 1896–97 are true, it would have been considerably more advanced than any airship built up to that time.\nSeveral individuals, including Lyman Gilmore and Charles Dellschau, were later identified as possible candidates for being involved in the design and construction of the airships, although little evidence was found in support of these ideas.\n\n\n=== Claims of extraterrestrial origin ===\nEarly sources citing the extraterrestrial hypothesis, all from 1897, include the Washington Times, which speculated that the airships were \"a reconnoitering party from Mars\"; and the Saint Louis Post-Dispatch, which suggested of the airships, \"these may be visitors from Mars, fearful, at the last, of invading the planet they have been seeking.\"  In 1909, a letter printed in the Otago Daily Times (New Zealand) suggested that the mystery airship sightings then being reported in that country were due to Martian \"atomic-powered spaceships.\"\n\n\n== See also ==\nAirship\nGhost rockets\n\n\n== Footnotes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nBusby, Michael (2004), Solving the 1897 Airship Mystery, Pelican, ISBN 1-58980-125-3.\nClark, Jerome (1998), The UFO Book: Encyclopedia of the Extraterrestrial, Visible Ink, ISBN 1-57859-029-9.\n——— (2000), \"The Extraterrestrial Hypothesis in the Early UFO Age\",  in Jacobs, David M, UFOs and Abductions: Challenging the Borders of Knowledge, University Press of Kansas, pp. 122–40, ISBN 0-7006-1032-4.\nGenini, Ron (May 1983), \"The Airship of \'96: Flight of Fancy or Flight in Fact?\", The Californians: The Magazine of California History, pp. 6–15.\nGenini, Ron (December 1979), \"Close Encounters of the Earliest Kind\", American Heritage, pp. 94–99.\nGorvetzian, Jeff (1998), \"Once Upon A Time In Aurora\", Fortean Times (115), archived from the original on 2007-04-09.\nThe Heirophant\'s Apprentice, \"The Fortean Times Random Dictionary of the Damned: No. 6: Airships & Scareships Part One: 1896–7\", Fortean Times (196), pp. 46–49.\n———, \"The Fortean Times Random Dictionary of the Damned: No. 7: Airships & Scareships Part Two: 1909–14\", Fortean Times (198), pp. 48–50.\nJacobs, David Michael (1975), The UFO Controversy In America, Indiana University Press, ISBN 0-253-19006-1.\nReece, Gregory L (August 21, 2007).

The observer is shrouded in darkness, while at high altitudes, sunlight is able to reflect off the exhaust that is being lit before dawn reaches lower altitudes or after dusk has already left lower altitudes, due the curvature of the Earth and its rotation causing the day-night cycle.

(71, 'Little Rissington UFO incident', 'The Little Rissington UFO incident was an encounter in October 1952 between a Gloster Meteor and three unidentified saucer-shaped objects over Gloucestershire.\n\n\n== Position ==\nRAF Little Rissington is a base to the west of the A424 in eastern Gloucestershire, east of Little Rissington in Cotswold District. From the 1940s, the base was the home of the Central Flying School. The eastern edge of the airfield meets the Oxfordshire boundary with Gloucestershire. The airfield is the point where the Gloucestershire boundary crosses the A424. \n\n\n== Encounter ==\nOn 21 October 1952 in the afternoon, Flt Lt (later Air Commodore) Michael Swiney, and Lieutenant David Crofts, a Royal Navy pilot, took off from RAF Little Rissington in a Gloster Meteor VII (T.7), powered by two Rolls-Royce Derwent engines, on a training flight. At 12,000ft, they came through a layer of cloud to witness three white saucer-shaped objects, which they reported to be at 35,000ft. Initially the pilots had believed the saucer-shaped objects to be three parachutes. The pilots noted that the shape of the saucer shape was \'perfectly circular\', and their Meteor aircraft climbed to 35,000ft.\nFlt Lt Swiney reported the sighting of the three saucer objects to his Ground Control at RAF Sopley, and abruptly cancelled the training flight. Lt Crofts asked whether to pursue the three objects, but Flt Lt Swiney declined. The three objects crossed over the Meteor\'s path, from left to right (starboard). The objects remained on their starboard side. In a fraction of a second, the objects disappeared. \nFrom 1952-54 the RAF lost 507 jets, with the loss of 112 aircrew.

(72, 'Alien abduction', 'The terms alien abduction  or abduction phenomenon describe \"subjectively real memories of being taken secretly against one\'s will by apparently nonhuman entities and subjected to complex physical and psychological procedures\". People claiming to have been abducted are usually called \"abductees\" or \"experiencers\". Typical claims involve being subjected to forced medical examinations that emphasize abductee reproductive systems. Abductees sometimes claim to have been warned against environmental abuse and the dangers of nuclear weapons.Due to a lack of objective physical evidence, most scientists and mental health professionals dismiss the phenomenon as \"deception, suggestibility (fantasy-proneness, hypnotizability, false memory syndrome), personality, sleep paralysis, psychopathology, psychodynamics [and] environmental factors\". Skeptic Robert Sheaffer sees similarity between the aliens depicted in science fiction films, in particular, Invaders From Mars (1953), and some of those reported to have actually abducted people.The first alleged alien abduction claim to be widely publicized was the Betty and Barney Hill abduction in 1961. Reports of the abduction phenomenon have been made around the world, but are most common in English speaking countries, especially the United States. The contents of the abduction narrative often seem to vary with the home culture of the alleged abductee.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nMainstream scientists reject claims that the phenomenon literally occurs as reported. However, there is little doubt that many apparently stable persons who report alien abductions believe their experiences were real. As reported in the Harvard University Gazette in 1992, Dr. John E. Mack reports that of the 60 cases of claimed abductees he had worked on, that after a battery  of psychological  tests, \"no  psychiatric  or  psychosocial explanation for these reports is evident. These people are not mentally ill. He has spent countless therapeutic hours with these individuals only to find that what struck him was the \'ordinariness\' of the population, including a restaurant owner, several secretaries, a prison guard, college students, a university administrator, and several homemakers … \'The majority of abductees do not appear to be deluded, confabulating, lying, self-dramatizing, or suffering from a clear mental illness,\' he maintained.\" \"While psychopathology is indicated in some isolated alien abduction cases,\" Stuart Appelle et al. confirmed, \"assessment by both clinical examination and standardized tests has shown that, as a group, abduction experients are not different from the general population in term of psychopathology prevalence.\" Other experts who have argued that abductees\' mental health is no better or worse than average include psychologists John Wilson and Rima Laibow, and psychotherapist David Gotlib.Some abduction reports are quite detailed. An entire subculture has developed around the subject, with support groups and a detailed mythos explaining the reasons for abductions: The various aliens (Greys, Reptilians, \"Nordics\" and so on) are said to have specific roles, origins, and motivations. Abduction claimants do not always attempt to explain the phenomenon, but some take independent research interest in it themselves and explain the lack of greater awareness of alien abduction as the result of either extraterrestrial or governmental interest in cover-up. Mack has cited more mundane reasons for the lack of general awareness concerning the data: \"The most intense demand for alternative explanations tends to come from those who are either unfamiliar with the rich complexity of the abduction phenomenon, or from those who are so wedded to a worldview\" that they find the phenomenon prima facie unacceptable.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Paleo-abductions ===\nWhile \"alien abduction\" did not achieve widespread attention until the 1960s, there were many similar stories circulating decades earlier. These early abduction-like accounts have been dubbed \"paleo-abductions\" by UFO researcher Jerome Clark.\nIn the November 27, 1896 edition of the Stockton, California Daily Mail, Colonel H. G. Shaw claimed he and a friend were harassed by three tall, slender humanoids whose bodies were covered with a fine, downy hair who tried to kidnap the pair.\nIn the October 1953 issue of Man to Man Magazine an article by Leroy Thorpe titled \"Are the Flying Saucers Kidnapping Humans?\" asks the question \"Are an unlucky few of us, and perhaps not so few at that, being captured with the same ease as we would net butterflies, perhaps for zoological specimens, perhaps for vivisection or some other horrible death designed to reveal to our interplanetary invaders what makes us tick?\" \nRogerson writes that the 1955 publication of Harold T. Wilkins\'s Flying Saucers Uncensored declared that Karl Hunrath and Wilbur Wilkinson, who had claimed they were contacted by aliens, had disappeared under mysterious circumstances; Wilkins reported speculation that the duo were the victims of \"alleged abduction by flying saucers\".\n\n\n=== Two landmark cases ===\nAn early alien abduction claim occurred in the mid-1950s with the Antonio Vilas Boas case, which did not receive much attention until several years later.\nWidespread publicity was generated by the Betty and Barney Hill abduction case of 1961, culminating in a made-for-television film broadcast in 1975 (starring James Earl Jones and Estelle Parsons) dramatizing the events. The Hill incident was probably the prototypical abduction case and was perhaps the first in which the claimant described beings that later became widely known as the Greys and in which the beings were said to explicitly identify an extraterrestrial origin.\nThough these two cases are sometimes viewed as the earliest abductions, skeptic Peter Rogerson notes they were only the first \"canonical\" abduction cases, establishing a template that later abductees and researchers would refine but rarely deviate from. Additionally, Rogerson notes purported abductions were cited contemporaneously at least as early as 1954, and that \"the growth of the abduction stories is a far more tangled affair than the \'entirely unpredisposed\' official history would have us believe.\" (The phrase \"entirely predisposed\" appeared in folklorist Thomas E. Allard\' study of alien abduction; he argued that alien abductions as reported in the 1970s and 1980s had little precedent in folklore or fiction.)\n\n\n=== Later developments ===\nR. Leo Sprinkle, a University of Wyoming psychologist, became interested in the abduction phenomenon in the 1960s. For some years, he was probably the only academic figure devoting any time to studying or researching abduction accounts. Sprinkle became convinced of the phenomenon\'s actuality, and was perhaps the first to suggest a link between abductions and cattle mutilation. Eventually Sprinkle came to believe that he had been abducted by aliens in his youth; he was forced from his job in 1989.Budd Hopkins had been interested in UFOs for some years. In the 1970s he became interested in abduction reports, and began using hypnosis to extract more details of dimly remembered events. Hopkins soon became a figurehead of the growing abductee subculture.The 1980s brought a major degree of mainstream attention to the subject. Works by Hopkins, novelist Whitley Strieber, historian David M. Jacobs and psychiatrist John E. Mack presented alien abduction as a genuine phenomenon. Also of note in the 1980s was the publication of folklorist Dr. Thomas E. Bullard\'s comparative analysis of nearly 300 alleged abductees.\nWith Hopkins, Jacobs and Mack, accounts of alien abduction became a prominent aspect of ufology. There had been earlier abduction reports (the Hills being the best known), but they were believed to be few and far between, and saw rather little attention from ufology (and even less attention from mainstream professionals or academics). Jacobs and Hopkins argued that alien abduction was far more common than earlier suspected; they estimate that tens of thousands (or more) North Americans had been taken by unexplained beings.Furthermore, Jacobs and Hopkins argued that there was an elaborate process underway in which aliens were attempting to create human–alien hybrids, the most advanced stage of which in the \"human hybridization program\" are known as hubrids, though the motives for this effort were unknown. There had been anecdotal reports of phantom pregnancy related to UFO encounters at least as early as the 1960s, but Budd Hopkins and especially David M. Jacobs were instrumental in popularizing the idea of widespread, systematic interbreeding efforts on the part of the alien intruders.\nThe descriptions of alien encounters as researched and presented by Hopkins, Jacobs and Mack were similar, with slight differences in each researcher\'s emphasis; the process of selective citation of abductee interviews that supported these variations was sometimes criticized – though abductees who presented their own accounts directly, such as Whitley Strieber, fared no better.\nThe involvement of Jacobs and Mack marked something of a sea change in the abduction studies. Their efforts were controversial (both men saw some degree of damage to their professional reputations), but to other observers, Jacobs and Mack brought a degree of respectability to the subject.\n\n\n==== John E. Mack ====\nMatheson writes that \"if Jacobs\'s credentials were impressive,\" then those of Harvard psychiatrist John E. Mack might seem \"impeccable\" in comparison. Mack was a well known, highly esteemed psychiatrist, author of over 150 scientific articles and winner of the Pulitzer Prize for his biography of T. E. Lawrence. Mack became interested in the phenomenon in the late 1980s, interviewing over 800 people, and eventually writing two books on the subject.\nMack devoted a substantial amount of time to investigating such cases and eventually concluded that the only phenomenon in psychiatry that adequately explained the patients\' symptoms in several of the most compelling cases was posttraumatic stress disorder. As he noted at the time, this would imply that the patient genuinely believed that the remembered frightening incident had really occurred – the position Mack came to endorse.In June 1992, Mack and the physicist David E. Pritchard organized a five-day conference at MIT to discuss and debate the abduction phenomenon. The conference attracted a wide range of professionals, representing a variety of perspectives.\nWriter C. D. B. Bryan attended the conference, initially intending to gather information for a short humorous article for The New Yorker. While attending the conference, however, Bryan\'s view of the subject changed, and he wrote a serious, open-minded book on the phenomenon, additionally interviewing many abductees, skeptics, and proponents.\n\n\n== Abductees ==\n\nThe precise number of alleged abductees is uncertain. One of the earliest studies of abductions found 1,700 claimants, while contested surveys argued that 5–6 percent of the general population might have been abducted.\n\n\n=== Demographics ===\nIn a study investigating the motivations of the alleged abductors, Jenny Randles found that in each of the 4 cases out of 50 total where the experiencer was over 40 years of age, they were rejected by the aliens for \"what they (the experiencers) usually inferred to be a medical reason.\" Randles concludes \"[T]he abduction is essentially a young person\'s experience.\" Given the reproductive focus of the alleged abductions it is not surprising that one man reported being rejected because he had undergone a vasectomy. It could also be partially because people over the age of 40 are less likely to have \"hormonic\" or reproductive activity going on.\nAlthough abduction and other UFO-related reports are usually made by adults, sometimes young children report similar experiences. These child-reports often feature very specific details in common with reports of abduction made by adults, including the circumstances, narrative, entities and aftermaths of the alleged occurrences. Often these young abductees have family members who have reported having abduction experiences. Family involvement in the military, or a residence near a military base is also common among child abduction claimants.\n\n\n=== Mental health ===\nAs a category, some studies show that abductees have psychological characteristics that render their testimony suspect, while others show that \"as a group, abduction experients are not different from the general population in term of psychopathology prevalence\". Dr. Elizabeth Slater conducted a blind study of nine abduction claimants and found them to be prone to \"mildly paranoid thinking,\" nightmares and having a weak sexual identity, while Dr. Richard McNally of Harvard Medical School concluded in a similar study of 10 abductees that \"none of them was suffering from any sort of psychiatric illness.\"\n\n\n=== Paranormal ===\nAlleged abductees are seen by many pro-abduction researchers to have a higher incidence of non-abduction related paranormal events and abilities. Following an abduction experience, these paranormal abilities and occurrences sometimes seem to become more pronounced. According to investigator Benton Jamison, abduction experiencers who report UFO sightings that should have been, but are not, reported by independent corroborating witnesses often seem to \"be \'psychic personalities\' in the sense of Jan Ehrenwald.\" Psychic Medium Danielle Egnew recounted multiple abduction experiences in her 2012 book True Tales of the Truly Weird, greatly detailing communication, technology and abduction methods of more than one alien race.\n\n\n== The abduction narrative ==\n\nAlthough different cases vary in detail (sometimes significantly), some UFO researchers, such as folklorist Thomas E. Bullard argue that there is a broad, fairly consistent sequence and description of events that make up the typical \"close encounter of the fourth kind\" (a popular but unofficial designation building on Dr. J. Allen Hynek\'s classifications). Though the features outlined below are often reported, there is some disagreement as to exactly how often they actually occur.\nBullard argues most abduction accounts feature the following events. They generally follow the sequence noted below, though not all abductions feature all the events:\n\nCapture. The abductee is somehow rendered incapable of resisting, and taken from terrestrial surroundings to an apparent alien spacecraft.\nExamination and Procedures. Invasive physiological and psychological procedures, and on occasion simulated behavioral situations, training & testing, or sexual liaisons.\nConference. The abductors communicate with the abductee or direct them to interact with specific individuals for some purpose, typically telepathically but sometimes using the abductee\'s native language.\nTour. The abductees are given a tour of their captors\' vessel, though this is disputed by some researchers who consider this definition a confabulation of intent when just apparently being taken around to multiple places inside the ship.\nLoss of Time. Abductees often rapidly forget the majority of their experience, either as a result of fear, medical intervention, or both.\nReturn. The abductees are returned to earth, occasionally in a different location from where they were allegedly taken or with new injuries or disheveled clothing.\nTheophany. Coinciding with their immediate return, abductees may have a profound sense of love, a \"high\" similar to those induced by certain drugs, or a \"mystical experience\", accompanied by a feeling of oneness with God, the universe, or their abductors. Whether this is the result of a metaphysical change, Stockholm syndrome, or prior medical tampering is often not scrutinized by the abductees at the time.\nAftermath. The abductee must cope with the psychological, physical, and social effects of the experience.When describing the \"abduction scenario\", David M. Jacobs says:\n\nThe entire abduction event is precisely orchestrated. All the procedures are predetermined. There is no standing around and deciding what to do next. The beings are task-oriented and there is no indication whatsoever that we have been able to find of any aspect of their lives outside of performing the abduction procedures.\n\n\n=== Capture ===\nAbduction claimants report unusual feelings preceding the onset of an abduction experience. These feelings manifest as a compulsive desire to be at a certain place at a certain time or as expectations that something \"familiar yet unknown,\" will soon occur. Abductees also report feeling severe, undirected anxiety at this point even though nothing unusual has actually occurred yet. This period of foreboding can last for up to several days before the abduction actually takes place or be completely absent.Eventually, the experiencer will undergo an apparent \"shift\" into an altered state of consciousness. British abduction researchers have called this change in consciousness \"the Oz Factor.\" External sounds cease to have any significance to the experiencer and fall out of perception. They report feeling introspective and unusually calm. This stage marks a transition from normal activity to a state of \"limited self-willed mobility.\" As consciousness shifts one or more lights are alleged to appear, occasionally accompanied by a strange mist. The source and nature of the lights differ by report; sometimes the light emanates from a source outside the house (presumably the abductors\' UFO), sometimes the lights are in the bedroom with the experiencer and transform into alien figures.As the alleged abduction proceeds, claimants say they will walk or be levitated into an alien craft, in the latter case often through solid objects such as walls, ceilings or a closed window. Alternatively, they may experience rising through a tunnel or along a beam of light, with or without the abductors accompanying them, into the awaiting craft.\n\n\n=== Examination ===\nThe examination phase of the so-called \"abduction narrative\" is characterized by the performance of medical procedures and examinations by apparently alien beings against or irrespective of the will of the experiencer. Such procedures often focus on sex and reproductive biology. However, the literature holds reports of a wide variety of procedures allegedly performed by the beings. The entity that appears to be in charge of the operation is often taller than the others involved, and is sometimes described as appearing to be of a different species.Miller notes different areas of emphasis between human medicine and what is reported as being practiced by the abductors. This could result from a difference in the purpose of the examination—routine diagnosis and/or treatment versus scientific examination of an unfamiliar species, or it could be due to a different level of technology that renders certain kinds of manual procedures unnecessary. The abductors\' areas of interest appear to be the cranium, nervous system, skin, reproductive system, and to a lesser degree, the joints. Systems given less attention than a human doctor would, or omitted entirely include cardiovascular system, the respiratory system below the pharynx and the lymphatic system. The abductors also appear to ignore the upper region of the abdomen in favor of the lower one. The abductors do not appear to wear gloves during the \"examination.\" Other constants of terrestrial medicine like pills and tablets are missing from abduction narratives although sometimes abductees are asked to drink liquids. Injections also seem to be rare and IVs are almost completely absent. Dr. Miller says he\'s never heard an abductee claim to have a tongue depressor used on them.\n\n\n=== Subsequent abduction procedures ===\nAfter the so-called medical exam, the alleged abductees often report other procedures being performed with the entities. Common among these post-examination procedures are what abduction researchers refer to as imaging, envisioning, staging, and testing.\"Imaging\" procedures consist of an abductee being made to view screens displaying images and scenes that appear to be specially chosen with the intent to provoke certain emotional responses in the abductee. \"Envisioning\" is a similar procedure, with the primary difference being that the images being viewed, rather than being on a screen, actually seem to be projected into the experiencer\'s mind. \"Staging\" procedures have the abductee playing a more active role, according to reports containing this element. It shares vivid hallucination-like mental visualization with the envisioning procedures, but during staging the abductee interacts with the illusionary scenario like a role player or an actor.\"Testing\" marks something of a departure from the above procedures in that it lacks the emotional analysis feature. During testing the experiencer is placed in front of a complicated electronic device and is instructed to operate it. The experiencer is often confused, saying that they do not know how to operate it. However, when they actually set about performing the task, the abductee will find that they do, in fact, know how to operate the machine.\n\n\n==== Child presentation ====\nAbductees of all ages and genders sometimes report being subjected to a \"child presentation.\" As its name implies, the child presentation involves the abduction claimant being shown a \"child.\" Often the children appear to be neither human, nor the same species as the abductors. Instead, the child will almost always share characteristics of both species. These children are labeled by experiencers as hybrids between humans and their abductors, usually Greys.\nUnlike Budd Hopkins and David Jacobs, folklorist Thomas E. Bullard could not identify a child presentation phase in the abduction narrative, even after undertaking a study of 300 abduction reports. Bullard says that the child presentation \"seems to be an innovation in the story\" and that \"no clear antecedents\" to descriptions of the child presentation phase exist before its popularization by Hopkins and Jacobs.\n\n\n=== Less common elements ===\nBullard also studied the 300 reports of alien abduction in an attempt to observe the less prominent aspects of the claims. He notes the emergence of four general categories of events that recur regularly, although not as frequently as stereotypical happenings like the medical examination. These four types of events are:\nThe conference\nThe tour\nThe journey\nTheophanyChronologically within abduction reports these rarer episodes tend to happen in the order listed, between the medical examination and the return.After allegedly displaying cold callous disregard towards the abduction experiencers, sometimes the entities will change drastically in behavior once the initial medical exam is completed. They become more relaxed and hospitable towards their captive and lead him or her away from the site of the examination. The entities then hold a conference with the experiencer, wherein they discuss things relevant to the abduction phenomenon. Bullard notes five general categories of discussion that occur during the conference \"phase\" of reported abduction narratives: An interrogation session, explanatory segment, task assignment, warnings, and prophecies.Tours of the abductors\' craft are a rare but recurring feature of the abduction narrative. The tour seems to be given by the alleged abductors as a courtesy in response to the harshness and physical rigors of the forced medical examination. Sometimes the abductees report traveling on a \"journey\" to orbit around Earth or to what appear to be other planets. Some abductees find that the experience is terrifying, particularly if the aliens are of a more fearsome species, or if the abductee was subjected to extensive probing and medical testing.\n\n\n=== Return ===\nEventually the abductors will return the abductees, usually to exactly the same location and circumstances they were in before being taken. Usually, explicit memories of the abduction experience will not be present, and the abductee will only realize they have experienced \"missing time\" upon checking a timepiece.Sometimes the alleged abductors appear to make mistakes when returning their captives. Famed UFO researcher Budd Hopkins has joked about \"the cosmic application of Murphy\'s Law\" in response to this observation. Hopkins has estimated that these \"errors\" accompany 4–5 percent of abduction reports. One type of common apparent mistake made by the abductors is failing to return the experiencer to the same spot that they were taken from initially. This can be as simple as a different room in the same house, or abductees can even find themselves outside and all the doors of the house are locked from the inside. Another common (and amusing) error is putting the abductee\'s clothes (e.g. pajamas) on backwards.\n\n\n=== Realization event ===\nPhysician and abduction researcher John G. Miller sees significance in the reason a person would come to see themselves as being a victim of the abduction phenomenon. He terms the insight or development leading to this shift in identity from non-abductee to abductee the \"realization event.\" The realization event is often a single, memorable experience, but Miller reports that not all abductees experience it as a distinct episode. Either way, the realization event can be thought of as the \"clinical horizon\" of the abduction experience.\n\n\n== Trauma and recovery ==\nMost people alleging alien abductions report invasive examinations of their bodies and some ascribe psychological trauma to their experiences. \"Post abduction syndrome\" is a term used by abductees to describe the effects of abduction, though it is not recognized by any professional treatment organizations. People who have a false memory which makes them believe that they have been abducted by aliens develop symptoms similar to post-traumatic stress disorder. People who believe they have been abducted by aliens usually have previous New Age beliefs, a vivid fantasy life, and suffer from sleep paralysis, according to a 2003 study by Harvard University.\n\n\n=== Support groups ===\nSupport groups for people who believed they were abducted began appearing in the mid-1980s. These groups appear throughout the United States, Canada and Australia.\n\n\n== The role of hypnosis ==\nMany alien abductees recall much of their abduction(s) through hypnosis. Due to the extensive use of hypnosis and other manipulative methods, skeptics explain the abduction narratives as false memories and suggestions.\n\n\n=== Argument against the use of hypnosis ===\nAlleged abductees seek out hypnotherapists to try to resolve issues such as missing time or unexplained physical symptoms such as muscle pain or headaches. This usually involves two phases, an information gathering stage, in which the hypnotherapist asks about unexplained illnesses or unusual phenomena during the patients lives (caused by or distortions of the alleged abduction), followed by hypnosis and guided imagery to facilitate recall. The information gathering enhances the likelihood that the events discussed will be incorporated into later abduction \"memories\". Seven steps are hypothesized to lead to the development of false memories:\nA person is predisposed to accept the idea that certain puzzling or inexplicable experiences might be telltale signs of UFO abduction.\nThe person seeks out a therapist, whom he or she views as an authority and who is, at the very least, receptive to this explanation and has some prior familiarity with UFO abduction reports.\nAlternatively, the therapist frames the puzzling experiences in terms of an abduction narrative.\nAlternative explanations of the experiences are not explored.\nThere is increasing commitment to the abduction explanation and increasing anxiety reduction associated with ambiguity reduction.\nThe therapist legitimates or ratifies the abductee\'s experience, which constitutes additional positive reinforcement.\nThe client adopts the role of the \"victim\" or abductee, which becomes integrated into the psychotherapy and the client\'s view of self.\n\n\n=== Argument for the use of hypnosis ===\nHarvard psychiatrist John E. Mack counters this argument, noting \"It might be useful to restate that a large proportion of the material relating to abductions is recalled without the use of an altered state of consciousness, and that many abduction reporters appear to relive powerful experiences after only the most minimal relaxation exercise, hardly justifying the word hypnosis at all. The relaxation exercise is useful to relieve the experiencer\'s need to attend to the social demands and other stimuli of face-to-face conversation, and to relieve the energies involved in repressing memories and emotion.\"\n\n\n== Perspectives ==\n\nThere have been a variety of explanations offered for abduction phenomena, ranging from sharply skeptical appraisals, to uncritical acceptance of all abductee claims, to the demonological, to everything in between.\nSome have elected not to try explaining things, instead noting similarities to other phenomena, or simply documenting the development of the alien abduction phenomenon.\nOthers are intrigued by the entire phenomenon, but hesitate in making any definitive conclusions. The late Harvard psychiatrist John E. Mack concluded, \"The furthest you can go at this point is to say there\'s an authentic mystery here. And that is, I think, as far as anyone ought to go.\" (emphasis as in original) Mack was unconvinced by piecemeal counterclaims, however, and countered that skeptical explanations naturally need to \"take into account the entire range of phenomena associated with abduction experiences,\" up to and including \"missing time,\" directly contemporaneous UFO sightings, and the occurrence in small children.Putting aside the question of whether abduction reports are literally and objectively \"real\", literature professor Terry Matheson argues that their popularity and their intriguing appeal are easily understood. Tales of abduction \"are intrinsically absorbing; it is hard to imagine a more vivid description of human powerlessness.\" After experiencing the frisson of delightful terror one may feel from reading ghost stories or watching horror movies, Matheson notes that people \"can return to the safe world of their homes, secure in the knowledge that the phenomenon in question cannot follow. But as the abduction myth has stated almost from the outset, there is no avoiding alien abductors.\"Matheson writes that when compared to the earlier contactee reports, abduction accounts are distinguished by their \"relative sophistication and subtlety, which enabled them to enjoy an immediately more favorable reception from the public.\"\nSome writers have said abduction experiences bear similarities to pre-20th century accounts of demonic manifestations, noting as many as a dozen similarities. One notable example is the Orthodox monk Fr. Seraphim Rose, who devotes a whole chapter in his book Orthodoxy and the Religion of the Future to the phenomena of UFOs and abductions, which, he concludes, are manifestations of the demonic.\n\n\n== Testimonials ==\nAbduction researcher Brian Thompson claims that a nurse acquaintance of his reported that during 1957 in Cincinnati she encountered a 3-foot-tall (0.91 m) praying mantis-like entity two days after a V-shaped UFO sighting. This mantis-like creature is reminiscent of the insectoid-type entity reported in some abduction accounts. He related this report to fellow researcher Leonard Stringfield. Stringfield told him of two cases he had in his files where separate witnesses reported identical circumstances in the same place and year.While some corroborated accounts seem to support the literal reality of the abduction experience, others seem to support a psychological explanation for the phenomenon\'s origins. Jenny Randles and Keith Basterfield both noted at the 1992 MIT alien abduction conference that of the five cases they knew of where an abduction researcher was present at the onset of an abduction experience, the experiencer \"didn\'t physically go anywhere.\"Brazilian researcher Gilda Moura reported on a similar case, the Sueli case, from her home country. When psychologist and UFO researcher Don Donderi said that these cases were \"evidence of psychological processes\" that did not \"have anything to do with a physical alien abduction,\" Moura replied \"If the Sueli case is not an abduction, I don\'t know what is an abduction any more.\" Gilda Moura noted that in the Brazilian Sueli case during the abduction UFOs were observed. Later, she claims the experiencer had eye burns, saw lights and there seemed to be residual poltergeist activity.\n\n\n=== Attempts at confirmation ===\n\nIt has been argued that if actual \"flesh and blood\" aliens are abducting humans, there should be some hard evidence that this is occurring. Proponents of the physical reality of the abduction experience have suggested ways that could conceivably confirm abduction reports.\nOne procedure reported occurring during the alleged exam phase of the experience is the insertion of a long needle-like contraption into a woman\'s navel. Some have speculated that this could be a form of laparoscopy. If this is true, after the abduction there should be free gas in the female\'s abdomen, which could be seen on an x-ray. The presence of free gas would be extremely abnormal, and would help substantiate the claim of some sort of procedure being done to her.\n\n\n== Notable abduction claims ==\n\n\n== Notable figures ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== Footnotes ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nBryan, C.

(73, 'Interdimensional hypothesis', 'The interdimensional hypothesis (IDH or IH), is an idea advanced by Ufologists such as Jacques Vallée that says unidentified flying objects (UFOs) and related events involve visitations from other \"realities\" or \"dimensions\" that coexist separately alongside our own. It is an alternative to the extraterrestrial hypothesis (ETH).\nIDH also holds that UFOs are a modern manifestation of a phenomenon that has occurred throughout recorded human history, which in prior ages were ascribed to mythological or supernatural creatures.Although ETH has remained the predominant explanation for UFOs by UFOlogists, some ufologists have abandoned it in favor of IDH. Paranormal researcher Brad Steiger wrote that \"we are dealing with a multidimensional paraphysical phenomenon that is largely indigenous to planet Earth\". Other UFOlogists, such as John Ankerberg and John Weldon, advocate IDH because it fits the explanation of UFOs as a spiritistic phenomenon. Commenting on the disparity between the ETH and the accounts that people have made of UFO encounters, Ankerberg and Weldon wrote \"the UFO phenomenon simply does not behave like extraterrestrial visitors.\" In the book UFOs: Operation Trojan Horse published in 1970, John Keel linked UFOs to folkloric or supernatural concepts such as ghosts and demons.\nThe development of IDH as an alternative to ETH increased in the 1970s and 1980s with the publication of books by Vallée and J. Allen Hynek. In 1975, Vallée and Hynek advocated the hypothesis in The Edge of Reality: A Progress Report on Unidentified Flying Objects and further, in Vallée\'s 1979 book Messengers of Deception: UFO Contacts and Cults.Some UFO proponents accepted IDH because the distance between stars makes interstellar travel impractical using conventional means and nobody had demonstrated an antigravity or faster-than-light travel hypothesis that could explain extraterrestrial machines. With IDH, it is unnecessary to explain any propulsion method because the IDH holds that UFOs are not spacecraft, but rather devices that travel between different realities.One advantage of IDH proffered by Hilary Evans is its ability to explain the apparent ability of UFOs to appear and disappear from sight and radar; this is explained as the UFO entering and leaving our dimension (\"materializing\" and \"dematerializing\"). Moreover, Evans argues that if the other dimension is slightly more advanced than ours, or is our own future, this would explain the UFOs\' tendency to represent near future technologies (airships in the 1890s, rockets and supersonic travel in the 1940s, etc.).IDH has been a causative factor in establishing UFO religion.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCultural tracking\nElemental\nEtherian\nInterdimensional being\nMultiverse\nMany-worlds interpretation\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nDavid Jacobs (December 1992).

(74, 'UFO sightings in Canada', 'Below is a partial list of alleged sightings of unidentified flying objects or UFOs in Canada.\n\n\n== 1960, Clan Lake, Northwest Territories ==\nOn June 18, 1960, a prospector told the Yellowknife RCMP detachment that a month earlier, he and his partner saw a UFO at Clan Lake, located 30 miles north of Yellowknife. According to UFOlogist Chris Rutkowski, the men claimed they saw a hovering object 4 to 6 feet wide that hit the surface of the lake. The RCMP investigated, but found nothing.\n\n\n== 1967, Falcon Lake, Manitoba incident ==\nStefan Michalak claimed he was burned by one of two flying saucers with which he reportedly came into contact on May 19, 1967 near Falcon Lake (Manitoba). Ufologists claim that images of Michalak in the hospital show a grid of burn marks on his chest, and a similar grid appears burned into his t-shirt. Ufologists consider it to be one of the most documented UFO stories in Canada.Two books have been written on the alleged Falcon Lake occurrence:\n\n(2017). Stan Michalak, Chris Rutkowski. When They Appeared Falcon Lake 1967: The inside story of a close encounter. ISBN 9781772800951\n(2015). George Dudding. The Falcon Lake UFO Encounter. ISBN 978-1514246825Skeptic Dr. Aaron Sakulich reviewed the report made by Michalak to police shortly after the incident, along with other evidence, and concluded that Michalak was indeed burned but that the burns were in fact likely caused by an accident brought on by alcohol consumption, and that Michalak, who was prospecting for silver ore near the lake at the time, probably made the story up to keep other prospectors out of the area.In April 2018, the Royal Canadian Mint released a $20 silver coin depicting the alleged event as part of its Canada\'s Unexplained Phenomena series, stating \"According to Stefan Michalak’s account, two glowing objects descended from the sky on May 20, 1967, near Falcon Lake, Manitoba, where one landed close enough for him to approach. When the craft suddenly took flight, its emission set Michalak’s clothes ablaze, leaving him with mysterious burns… and an unusual tale to tell.\"\n\n\n== 1967, Shag Harbour, Nova Scotia incident ==\n\nThe incident was the purported crash of an Unidentified Flying Object in Shag Harbour, Nova Scotia in October 1967.\n\n\n== 1969, Prince George, B.C. UFO ==\nIn Prince George, British Columbia, three unrelated witnesses reported a strange, round object in the late afternoon sky on January 1, 1969. The sphere radiated a yellow-orange light and appeared to ascend from 2,000 to 10,000 feet.\n\n\n== 1975-1976, Southern Manitoba ==\nSeveral sightings were reported of a red glowing UFO, sometimes described as \"mischievous\" or \"playful\", sighted in Southern Manitoba in 1975 and 1976.\n\n\n== 1978, Clarenville, Newfoundland and Labrador ==\nIn October 1978, Constable Jim Blackwood of the RCMP witnessed a sighting of a flying saucer hovering over the harbour near the town of Clarenville and Random Island.  This was reported to him by local citizens.  When he arrived at the scene the UFO was still present and quite visible. He had a special high powered viewing scope which happened to be on loan at the time for other surveillance.  The craft stayed in the area for approximately an hour and a half.  When he switched on the roof lights of his police cruiser the craft appeared to mimic the flashing lights.  This made headline news at the time and was broadcast on CBC television and NTV broadcasting in Newfoundland.  The craft took off like a shooting star high in the sky and disappeared. Two years after the incident the BBC did a documentary on UFO sightings and included the Clarenville sighting in their broadcast.  In later years Cst Blackwood retired to his native home in Stellarton, Nova Scotia.\n\n\n== 1986, Munros Point, Nova Scotia Sighting ==\nIn the early evening of January 20, 1986 a couple travelling by car on a rural road in Cape Breton, NS witnessed a bright light appear and hover directly over their car. Almost immediately their vehicle lost power. After watching the blinding light for less than a minute, they watched it quickly accelerate away from them, lighting up the ground below the object as it departed.\n\n\n== 1989, Marieville, Quebec ==\nOn November 20 at 5.30 p.m., in Sainte-Marie-de-Monnoir (a rural neighbourhood of Marieville) several people heard a noise similar to an electric generator and saw some strange lights in the sky. Two days after the phenomenon a perfect round circle was found outside the residence of Mr Jean Prigent, one of the witnesses of the sighting.\n\n\n== 1990, Montreal aerial phenomenon ==\nOn November 7, 1990, in Montreal, Quebec, witnesses reported a round, metallic object of about 540 metres wide over the rooftop pool of the Bonaventure Hotel. Eyewitnesses saw 8 to 10 lights forming into a circle above them, emitting bright white rays. The phenomenon lasted three hours, from 7 to 10 p.m., and moved slowly northwards. While none could identify the lights, a few witnesses, according to the next day’s report in La Presse, were ready to express their belief that they were visited by aliens.A few witnesses say what they saw in a televised interview on CBC.\n\n\n== 2006, Ajax, Ontario ==\nA UFO was photographed in Ajax, Ontario.\n\n\n== 2010, Harbour Mille incident ==\nDuring the night of January 25, 2010 there were multiple UFO sighting reports in Harbour Mille, Newfoundland and Labrador. Royal Canadian Mounted Police initially stated the reports were due to a missile launch, but later retracted the statement, and the Office of the Prime Minister stated that the UFOS were not missiles. Another minor report of this incident came from Calgary where boys playing hockey reported seeing similar objects, about which they stated \"We thought they were Transformers\"\n\n\n== 2014, Kensington, PEI Sighting ==\nWhile putting out a bonfire late in the evening of June 4, 2014, John Sheppard witnessed unusual lights in the sky over the Gulf of St. Lawrence and captured 22 minutes of it on his cellphone. After reporting the incident to MUFON and their investigation concluding it being a confirmed sighting, CBC covered the event. The next day, CBC released a follow-up article in which a series of alternate explanations for the event were presented.\n\n\n== 2014, Multiple reports of UFO sightings over Toronto, Ontario ==\nThere were multiple reports of a UFO activity above Toronto in the last week of July 2014.\n\n\n== Canadian UFO survey results ==\nAccording to the 2002 Canadian UFO Survey published by Ufology Research of Manitoba, Toronto had the largest number of sightings with 34, followed by Vancouver with 31 and Terrace, B.C. with 25 reports. In 2002, a typical UFO sighting lasted approximately 15 minutes.\nThe Canadian Federal Government currently (2007) directs all UFO sightings to Chris Rutkowski of Ufology Research of Manitoba.On July 15, 2018, a Canadian news site mentioned a new study conducted by Ufology Research, formerly known as Ufology Research of Manitoba, stating there have been more than 1,000 UFO sightings reported in Canada in 2017.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Latest UFO Sightings in Canada (latest-ufos.com)\nThe Latest UFO Sightings (ufosightings.ca)\nMUFON - Last 20 Sightings Reports\nAlberta UFO Research Group (AUFORG)\nAlberta UFO Study Group (AUFOSG)\nAssociation Québécoise d\'Ufologie (AQU)\nCanadian Crop Circle Research Network\nCanadian UFO Report - The Canadian UFO Survey\nCanada\'s Unidentified Flying Objects: The Search for the Unknown, a virtual museum exhibition at Library and Archives Canada\nCanadian X-Files - Comprehensive UFO Research Site, Joe Daniels - Extensive amount of government documents at this site.\nHBCC Research - HBCCUFO - British Columbia\nORBWATCH, Info.

(75, 'Identification studies of UFOs', 'Identifying unidentified flying objects is a difficult task due to the normally poor quality of the evidence provided by those who report sighting the unknown object. Observations and subsequent reporting are often made by those untrained in astronomy, atmospheric phenomena, aeronautics, physics, and perception. Nevertheless, most officially investigated UFO sightings, such as from the U.S. Air Force\'s Project Blue Book, have been identified as being due to honest misidentifications of natural phenomena, aircraft, or other prosaic explanations. In early U.S. Air Force attempts to explain UFO sightings, unexplained sightings  routinely numbered over one in five reports. However, in early 1953, right after the CIA\'s Robertson Panel, percentages of unexplained sightings dropped precipitously, usually being only a few percent in any given year. When Project Blue Book closed down in 1970, only 6% of all cases were classified as being truly unidentified.\nUFOs that can be explained are sometimes termed \"IFOs\" or Identified Flying Objects.\n\n\n== UFO studies ==\nThe following are some major studies undertaken during the past 50 years that reported on identification of UFOs:\n\nProject Blue Book Special Report No. 14 (referred to further below as BBSR) was a massive statistical study the Battelle Memorial Institute did for the USAF of 3,200 UFO cases between 1952 and 1954. Of these, 22% were classified as unidentified (“true UFOs”). Another 69% were deemed identified (IFOs). There was insufficient information to make a determination in the remaining 9%.\nThe official French government UFO investigation (GEPAN/SEPRA), run within the French space agency CNES between 1977 and 2004, scientifically investigated about 6000 cases and found that 13% defied any rational explanation (UFOs), while 46% were deemed readily identifiable and 41%, lacked sufficient information for classification.\nThe USAF-sponsored Condon Committee study reported that all 117 cases studies were or could probably be explained. A 1971 review of the results by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics concluded that 30% of the 117 cases remained unexplained.\nOf about 5,000 cases submitted to and studied by the civilian UFO organization NICAP, 16% were judged unknowns.In contrast, much more conservative numbers for the percentage of UFOs were arrived at individually by astronomer Allan Hendry, who was the chief investigator for the Center for UFO Studies (CUFOS). CUFOS was founded by astronomer J. Allen Hynek (who had been a consultant for the Air Force’s Project Blue Book) to provide a serious scientific investigation into UFOs. Hendry spent 15 months personally investigating 1,307 UFO reports. In 1979, Hendry published his conclusions in The UFO Handbook: A Guide to Investigating, Evaluating, and Reporting UFO Sightings. Hendry admitted that he would like to find evidence for extraterrestrials but noted that the vast majority of cases had prosaic explanations. He found 89% of reports definitely or probably identifiable and only 9% unidentified. “Hardcore” cases—well-documented events which defied any conceivable conventional explanation—made up only 1.5% of the reports.\n\n\n=== Project Blue Book Special Report No. 14 ===\nProject Blue Book Special Report No. 14 was compiled between 1951 and 1954, and included 3201 reported UFO sightings. Battelle employed four scientific analysts, who sought to divide cases into \"knowns\", \"unknowns\", and a third category of \"insufficient information.\" They also broke down knowns and unknowns into four categories of quality, from excellent to poor. In order for a case to be deemed \"identified\", two analysts had to independently agree on a solution and for a case to be called \"unidentified\", all four analysts had to agree. A report classified as \"unidentified\" was defined as: \"Those reports of sightings wherein the description of the object and its maneuvers could not be fitted to the pattern of any known object or phenomenon.\"\nOut of 3,201 cases, 69% were judged to be identified, 22% were unidentified, and 9% had insufficient information to make a determination.\n\n\n==== Breakdown by category of IFO and case quality ====\nBBSR further broke these results down based on whether the identification was considered certain or merely doubtful. For example, in both the astronomical and aircraft IFO categories, 12% were considered certain and 9% were doubtful. Overall, of the 69% listed as IFOs, 42% were thought to be solved with certainty, while 27% were still considered doubtful.\nIn addition, if a case was lacking in adequate data, it was placed in the insufficient information category, separate from both IFOs and UFOs.\n\n\n==== Military vs. civilian breakdown ====\nThe Battelle BBSR study included of many internal military reports; fully 38% of the cases were designated as military. Military witnesses tended to submit better quality reports, had much fewer reports rated as having insufficient information, and had higher percentages of unknowns. As in the previous breakdown, the percentage of UFOs again rose with case quality for both the military and civilian subcategories.\nIn the summary table, best reports are those rated excellent and good; worst reports are doubtful and poor.\n\n\n==== Comparison of IFOs to UFOs by characteristics ====\nA key study of BBSR was to statistically compare IFOs and UFOs by six characteristics: color, number of objects, shape, duration of observations, speed, and light brightness. If there were no significant differences, the two classes were probably the same, the UFOs then representing merely a failure to properly identify prosaic phenomena that could already account for the IFOs. On the other hand, if the differences were statistically significant, this would suggest IFOs and UFOs were indeed distinctly different phenomena.\nIn the initial results, all characteristics except brightness tested significant at less or much less than 1% (brightness was greater than 5%). By removing \"astronomical\" sightings from the \"knowns\" and redoing the test, just two categories, number and speed, were significant at less than 1%, the remainder having results between 3% and 5%. This indicated that there was a statistically significant difference between the characteristics ascribed to UFOs and IFOs, but perhaps not as significant as the initial results suggested. For two characteristics, brightness and speed, the significance actually increased with the revised test.\n\n\n=== Allan Hendry study ===\nLike the Air Force, astronomer Allan Hendry found that only a small percentage of cases were hoaxes and that most sightings were actually honest misidentifications of prosaic phenomena. Hendry attributed most of these to inexperience or misperception.\nOut of 1,307 cases Hendry deemed 88.6% had clear prosaic explanations (IFOs) and only 8.6% were unknowns (UFOs). Of the UFOs, Hendry reported that 7.1%, might still have a prosaic explanation while 1.5% (20 cases) had no possible plausible explanation and were completely unexplained. The remaining miscellaneous cases (2.8%) were “garbage” cases, where Hendry deemed the witnesses unreliable, the reports hopelessly contradictory, or lacking in sufficient information.\nOverall, in the three major categories, 42% of all cases had astronomical explanations, 37% were aircraft, and 5% were balloons. A further breakdown allowed 77% to be readily explained by five main classes of objects: 29% were bright stars or planets, 19% were advertising planes, 15% were other aircraft, 9% were meteors and reentering space debris, and 5% were balloons of various types (mostly weather or advertising balloons but also a few prank balloons).\n\n\n==== Breakdown of cases ====\nHendry also used a case classification system developed by his mentor J. Allen Hynek, who established CUFOS, where the study was carried out. In this summary table:\n\nNL = “Nocturnal Lights”, lights seen in the sky at night.\nDD = “Daylight Discs”, objects seen in daytime (but not necessarily disc in shape).\nRV = “Radar/Visual” cases, objects observed by both witnesses and radar.\nCE = “Close Encounter” cases. For convenience, CE cases listed below are combined totals of Hynek’s CE1, CE2, and CE3 cases, where:\nCE1 cases where objects were thought to be seen up close (within 500 feet).\nCE2 had purported physical interactions with the environment (physical trace cases or electromagnetic interference).\nCE3 cases were supposed to involve sightings of occupants.\n\n\n== Common causes of misidentification and UFOs ==\nBoth BBSR and Hendry found that three classes of objects or phenomena—astronomical, aircraft, or balloons—accounted for a large majority of identifiable UFO reports (referred to as IFOs), 86% and 83% in the two studies. For example, in Hendry’s study, bright stars and planets made up 29% of all cases while meteors (and to a much lesser extent, re-entering space debris) made up 9%. Hovering aircraft such as helicopters or blimps, or aircraft that appear to be hovering, such as airplanes seen at night from the front with their headlights on as they approach for landing can often confuse witnesses, as can aircraft strobe lights. BBSR reported a much higher percentage of balloons than Hendry.\nClaims of misidentification are after-the-fact analyses, not direct observations, and are often misconstrued by skeptics and UFO advocates alike: They do not suggest that the experiences did not exist, but merely that they can be explained by prosaic  causes. For instance, retrospective analyses of the Jimmy Carter UFO incident of 1969 connect the sighting with the known position of the planet Venus for that time, date, and location. Gordon Cooper, a strong advocate of the extraterrestrial hypothesis (ETH), claimed to have been fooled by the planet Venus when he was a fighter pilot,  thinking it a distant enemy plane, and the 1967 \"flying cross\" of Devon, England and the 1966  Portage County UFO Chase case have both been associated with astronomical sources.\nIn 2009, Peter Davenport, Director of the National UFO Reporting Center, posted this complaint online:\n\nWe are receiving hundreds of reports every month of normal, terrestrial events, e.g. over-flights of the International Space Station, the Space Shuttle, or satellites; “flares” of light from “Iridium” satellites; the appearance of typical meteors; and observations of normal, “twinkling” stars, planets, contrails, clusters of balloons, etc.  In fact, the overwhelming majority of reports that we receive now are of these normal objects and events, and processing the reports is taking a huge amount of our time... I believe the majority of time I spend on the Hotline is devoted to trying to convince people who have been staring for hours at a star or planet that the object of interest is not a UFO.\nThere are several natural and man-made objects that are commonly suggested as explanations for UFO sightings:\n\n\n=== Venus ===\nVenus is the brightest object in the sky (except for the sun, the moon and the International Space Station), and is often visible in the early evening and morning sky. Even experienced witnesses, especially when they are in unfamiliar surroundings or unusual atmospheric conditions, can fail to identify Venus correctly. However, the location of Venus is easily calculable, and professional astronomers report that many of the phone calls they receive from concerned citizens reporting the presence of a UFO are due to observations of the planet. Astronomer Phil Plait, in particular, has suggested that Venus is responsible for a majority of all UFO reports\n\n\n=== Meteors ===\nThe brightest meteors known as bolides are long lasting fireballs that leave a trail in the sky which can be visible for up to an hour after passing. Such events are relatively rare but can be witnessed by a large area of the Earth since most events occur kilometers up in the atmosphere. Those witnessing such events who are not familiar with meteors can be easily fooled into thinking that the meteor is a UFO. Because meteors are not predictable with the same degree of accuracy as planets, stars, or man-made objects such as satellites, these occurrences are more difficult to prove in retrospect, though UFO sightings during meteor showers, or where there are astronomical reports of bolides, are likely to be explained as such.\n\n\n=== Weather balloons, aircraft, satellites and other man-made objects ===\n\n\n=== Lenticular clouds ===\n\n\n=== Misperception ===\nLight distortion from air turbulence can cause celestial bodies to move to a limited degree as can a visual perceptual effect called the autokinetic effect, caused by small, involuntary eye movements after staring at a star-like light against a black background without a frame of reference. To some observers, these may cause stars and planets to appear to start and stop, change direction, or dart around. Hendry and other UFO skeptics attribute complex patterns of apparent motion in UFO reports to the autokinetic effect.Another type of misperceived motion sometimes occurs when people are driving in a vehicle. Witnesses may believe the “UFO” was following them even though the celestial body was actually stationary. Even police and other normally reliable witnesses can occasionally be fooled by sightings of bright stars and planets.\nIn about 10% of Hendry’s cases caused by celestial bodies, witnesses greatly underestimated distances to the objects, giving distance estimates ranging from 200 feet to 125 miles (60 m to 200 km).\nAccording to Hendry, moving clouds may also sometimes confuse observers by creating induced motion. Hendry believes this occasionally makes observers also believe objects have suddenly disappeared or make a rapid departure.\n\n\n==== Fata Morgana ====\n\nFata Morgana is a type of mirage responsible for some UFO sightings, by making objects located below the astronomical horizon appear to be hovering in the sky. It also magnifies images and makes them look unrecognizable.\nThe UFOs seen on radar can also be due to Fata Morgana, since water vapor in the air can create radar mirages more readily than temperature inversions can create optical mirages. According to GEPAN/SEPRA, the official UFO investigation in France,\n\nAs is well known, atmospheric ducting is the explanation for certain optical mirages, and in particular the arctic illusion called \"fata morgana\" where distant ocean or surface ice, which is essentially flat, appears to the viewer in the form of vertical columns and spires, or \"castles in the air.\" People often assume that mirages occur only rarely. This may be true of optical mirages, but conditions for radar mirages are more common, due to the role played by water vapor which strongly affects the atmospheric refractivity in relation to radio waves. Since clouds are closely associated with high levels of water vapor, optical mirages due to water vapor are often rendered undetectable by the accompanying opaque cloud. On the other hand, radar propagation is essentially unaffected by the water droplets of the cloud so that changes in water vapor content with altitude are very effective in producing atmospheric ducting and radar mirages.\n\n\n=== Other misidentifications ===\nThe BBSR and Hendry studies identified as rare causes for UFO reports based on misidentification, such objects and phenomena as birds, light phenomena (including mirages, moondogs, sundogs, auroras, ground lights such as street lights, and searchlights reflected off of clouds), and atmospheric phenomena such as clouds, dust and fog (including unusual cloud formations such as lenticular clouds, noctilucent clouds, rainbow effects, and high-altitude ice crystals). Other identified causes included kites, flares, reflections off windows, and windborn debris.\n\n\n==== Upper atmospheric lightning ====\nMore recently, Professor Colin Price head of the Geophysics and Planetary Sciences Department at Tel Aviv University has commented that occurrences of upper-atmospheric lightning such as sprites, elves and blue jets could account for some of the strange reports of UFO sightings.\n\n\n==== Astronomical object misidentification ====\nThe frequent reporting of bright stars and planets as UFOs has caused at least one misidentification. In August 1965 the U.S. Air Force tried to explain widespread UFO sightings in the midwest as bright stars in or near the constellation Orion. However, Orion, a winter constellation, was still well below the horizon at the time, a fact quickly pointed out by some astronomers, and the Air Force was forced to make a hasty retraction.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAstronomical Causes of UFOs (Ian Ridpath)\nUFO misidentifications list and link\nIFO cases caused by stratospheric balloons\nCommon IFO Phenomenon (Robert Moore)\nText of UFO STUDY Part 1 (UFO Investigation), gives detailed description of various IFO types (Jenny Randles)', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f4/Fata_Morgana_Example.jpg'),
(76, 'Reptilian humanoid', 'Reptilian humanoids or simply, reptilians (also called reptoids, lizard people, reptiloids, saurians, Draconians) are purported humanoids with the characteristics of reptiles that play a prominent role in fantasy, science fiction, ufology, and conspiracy theories. The idea of reptilians was popularised by David Icke, a conspiracy theorist who claims shape-shifting reptilian aliens control Earth by taking on human form and gaining political power to manipulate human societies. Icke has stated on multiple occasions that many world leaders are, or are possessed by, so-called reptilians.\n\n\n== Origins ==\nMichael Barkun, professor of political science at Syracuse University, posits that the idea of a reptilian conspiracy originated in the fiction of Conan the Barbarian creator Robert E. Howard. The first appearance of \"serpent men\" in literature was in Howard\'s story \"The Shadow Kingdom\", published in Weird Tales in August 1929. This story drew on theosophical ideas of the \"lost worlds\" of Atlantis and Lemuria, particularly Helena Blavatsky\'s The Secret Doctrine, with its reference to \"\'dragon-men\' who once had a mighty civilization on a Lemurian continent\".Howard\'s \"serpent men\" were described as humanoid with human bodies but snake heads, able to imitate real humans at will, who lived in hiding in underground passages, using their shapechanging and mind control abilities to infiltrate humanity. Clark Ashton Smith used Howard\'s \"serpent men\" in his stories, as well as themes from H. P. Lovecraft, and he, Howard and Lovecraft together laid the basis for the Cthulhu Mythos.In the 1940s, a non-fiction writer, Maurice Doreal, wrote a pamphlet entitled \"Mysteries of the Gobi\" that described a \"serpent race\" with \"bodies like man but...heads...like a great snake\" and an ability to take true human form. These creatures also appeared in Doreal\'s poem \"The Emerald Tablets\", in which he referred to Emerald Tablets written by \"Thoth, an Atlantean Priest king\". Barkun asserts that \"in all likelihood\", Doreal\'s ideas came from \"The Shadow Kingdom\", and that in turn, \"The Emerald Tablets\" formed the basis for David Icke\'s book, Children of the Matrix.\n\n\n== Alien abduction ==\nAlien abduction narratives sometimes allege contact with reptilian creatures. One of the earliest reports was that of Ashland, Nebraska police officer Herbert Schirmer (born 1945), who under hypnosis recalled being taken aboard a UFO in 1967 by humanoid beings with a slightly reptilian appearance, who wore a \"winged serpent\" emblem on the left side of their chests. Skeptics consider his claims to be a hoax.\n\n\n== David Icke ==\nAccording to British conspiracy theorist David Icke, tall, blood-drinking, shape-shifting reptilian humanoids from the Alpha Draconis star system, now hiding in underground bases, are the force behind a worldwide conspiracy against humanity. He contends that most of the world\'s ancient and modern leaders are related to these reptilians, including the Merovingian dynasty, the Rothschilds, the Bush family and the British Royal family. Icke\'s conspiracy theories now have supporters in up to 47 countries and he has given lectures to crowds of up to 6,000. American writer Vicki Santillano included it in her list of the 10 most popular conspiracy theories, describing it as the \"wackiest theory\" she had encountered.A poll of Americans in 2013 by Public Policy Polling indicated that 4% of registered voters (±2.8%) believed in David Icke\'s ideas.\n\n\n== Politics ==\nIn the closely fought 2008 U.S. Senate election in Minnesota between comedian and commentator Al Franken and incumbent Senator Norm Coleman, one of the ballots challenged by Coleman included a vote for Franken with \"Lizard People\" written in the space provided for write-in candidates.  Lucas Davenport, who later claimed to have written the gag ballot, said, \"I don\'t know if you\'ve heard the conspiracy theory about the Lizard Men; a friend of mine, we didn\'t like the candidates, so we were at first going to write in \'revolution\', because we thought that was good and to the point. And then, we thought \'the Lizard People\' would be even funnier.\"\"Evil reptilian kitten-eater from another planet\" was a pejorative used to refer to then Ontario Liberal Party opposition leader Dalton McGuinty in a press release disseminated by the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario on September 12, 2003, during the provincial election campaign in Ontario, Canada.\nIn February 2011, on the Opie and Anthony radio show, the comedian Louis C.K. jokingly asked former U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld a number of times if he and Dick Cheney were lizard people who enjoyed the taste of human flesh. Amused by Rumsfeld\'s refusal to directly answer the question, C.K. suggested it as a possible admission of guilt. He went on to further muse that perhaps those who are lizard people cannot lie about it; when asked if they are lizards, they either have to avoid answering the question or say yes.On March 4, 2013, a video depicting a security agent with unusual features guarding a speech by U.S. President Barack Obama was spotlighted in a Wired report about shapeshifting reptilian humanoids, leading to a tongue-in-cheek response from chief National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden that \"any alleged program to guard the president with aliens or robots would likely have to be scaled back or eliminated in the sequester\".\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nV is a science fiction franchise created by American writer, producer and director Kenneth Johnson about a genocidal invading alien race known as the \"Visitors\" – reptilian humanoids disguised as human beings – trying to take over Earth, and the human reaction to this, including the Resistance group attempting to stop them, while others collaborate with the aliens for power and personal wealth. Three years after the 1981 wedding of Prince Charles and Princess Diana the 1984 TV series of V included a planned wedding between two of the leading Visitors,  Charles and Diana, although Charles got murdered before the marriage could take place. It has sometimes been suggested that some aspects of the franchise may have helped inspire some of David Icke\'s above-mentioned theories.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Reptilians at Wikimedia Commons', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cc/Reptilian.svg'),
(77, 'Electronic voice phenomenon', 'Within ghost hunting and parapsychology, electronic voice phenomena (EVP) are sounds found on electronic recordings that are interpreted as spirit voices that have been either unintentionally recorded or intentionally requested and recorded. Parapsychologist Konstantīns Raudive, who popularized the idea in the 1970s, described EVP as typically brief, usually the length of a word or short phrase.Enthusiasts consider EVP to be a form of paranormal phenomenon often found in recordings with static or other background noise. However, scientists regard EVP as a form of auditory pareidolia (interpreting random sounds as voices in one\'s own language) and a pseudoscience promulgated by popular culture. Prosaic explanations for EVP include apophenia (perceiving patterns in random information), equipment artifacts, and hoaxes.\n\n\n== History ==\nAs the Spiritualist religious movement became prominent in the 1840s–1920s with a distinguishing belief that the spirits of the dead can be contacted by mediums, new technologies of the era including photography were employed by spiritualists in an effort to demonstrate contact with a spirit world. So popular were such ideas that Thomas Edison was asked in an interview with Scientific American to comment on the possibility of using his inventions to communicate with spirits. He replied that if the spirits were only capable of subtle influences, a sensitive recording device would provide a better chance of spirit communication than the table tipping and ouija boards mediums employed at the time. However, there is no indication that Edison ever designed or constructed a device for such a purpose. As sound recording became widespread, mediums explored using this technology to demonstrate communication with the dead as well. Spiritualism  declined in the latter part of the 20th century, but attempts to use portable recording devices and modern digital technologies to communicate with spirits continued.\n\n\n=== Early interest ===\nAmerican photographer Attila von Szalay was among the first to try recording what he believed to be voices of the dead as a way to augment his investigations in photographing ghosts. He began his attempts in 1941 using a 78 rpm record, but it wasn\'t until 1956 — after switching to a reel-to-reel tape recorder — that he believed he was successful. Working with Raymond Bayless, von Szalay conducted a number of recording sessions with a custom-made apparatus, consisting of a microphone in an insulated cabinet connected to an external recording device and speaker. Szalay reported finding many sounds on the tape that could not be heard on the speaker at the time of recording, some of which were recorded when there was no one in the cabinet. He believed these sounds to be the voices of discarnate spirits. Among the first recordings believed to be spirit voices were such messages as \"This is G!\", \"Hot dog, Art!\", and \"Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to you all\".  Von Szalay and Raymond Bayless\' work was published by the Journal of the American Society for Psychical Research in 1959. Bayless later went on to co-author the 1979 book, Phone Calls From the Dead.\nIn 1959, Swedish painter and film producer Friedrich Jürgenson was recording bird songs. Upon playing the tape later, he heard what he interpreted to be his dead father\'s voice and then the spirit of his deceased wife calling his name. He went on to make several more recordings, including one that he said contained a message from his late mother.\n\n\n=== Raudive voices ===\nKonstantin Raudive, a Latvian psychologist who had taught at the Uppsala University, Sweden and who had worked in conjunction with Jürgenson, made over 100,000 recordings which he described as being communications with discarnate people. Some of these recordings were conducted in an RF-screened laboratory and contained words Raudive said were identifiable. In an attempt to confirm the content of his collection of recordings, Raudive invited listeners to hear and interpret them. He believed that the clarity of the voices heard in his recordings implied that they could not be readily explained by normal means. Raudive published his first book, Breakthrough: An Amazing Experiment in Electronic Communication with the Dead in 1968 and it was translated into English in 1971.\n\n\n=== Spiricom and Frank\'s Box ===\nIn 1980, William O\'Neil constructed an electronic audio device called \"The Spiricom\". O\'Neil claimed the device was built to specifications which he received psychically from George Mueller, a scientist who had died six years previously. At a Washington, DC press conference on April 6, 1982, O\'Neil stated that he was able to hold two-way conversations with spirits through the Spiricom device, and provided the design specifications to researchers for free. However, nobody is known to have replicated the results O\'Neil claimed using his own Spiricom devices. O\'Neil\'s partner, retired industrialist George Meek, attributed O\'Neil\'s success, and the inability of others to replicate it, to O\'Neil\'s mediumistic abilities forming part of the loop that made the system work.Another electronic device specifically constructed in an attempt to capture EVP is \"Frank\'s Box\" or the \"Ghost Box\", created in 2002 by EVP enthusiast Frank Sumption for supposed real-time communication with the dead. Sumption claims he received his design instructions from the spirit world. The device is described as a combination white noise generator and AM radio receiver modified to sweep back and forth through the AM band selecting split-second snippets of sound. Critics of the device say its effect is subjective and incapable of being replicated, and since it relies on radio noise, any meaningful response a user gets is purely coincidental, or simply the result of pareidolia. Paranormal researcher Ben Radford writes that Frank\'s Box is a \"modern version of the Ouija board... also known as the \'broken radio\'\".\n\n\n=== Modern interest ===\nIn 1982, Sarah Estep founded the American Association of Electronic Voice Phenomena (AA-EVP) in Severna Park, Maryland, a nonprofit organization with the purpose of increasing awareness of EVP, and of teaching standardized methods for capturing it. Estep began her exploration of EVP in 1976, and says she has made hundreds of recordings of messages from deceased friends, relatives, and extraterrestrials whom she speculated originated from other planets or dimensions.The term Instrumental Trans-Communication (ITC) was coined by Ernst Senkowski in the 1970s to refer more generally to communication through any sort of electronic device such as tape recorders, fax machines, television sets or computers between spirits or other discarnate entities and the living. One particularly famous claimed incidence of ITC occurred when the image of EVP enthusiast Friedrich Jürgenson (whose funeral was held that day) was said to have appeared on a television in the home of a colleague, which had been purposefully tuned to a vacant channel. ITC enthusiasts also look at the TV and video camera feedback loop of the Droste effect.In 1979, parapsychologist D. Scott Rogo described an alleged paranormal phenomenon in which people report that they receive simple, brief, and usually single-occurrence telephone calls from spirits of deceased relatives, friends, or strangers. Rosemary Guiley has written \"within the parapsychology establishment, Rogo was often faulted for poor scholarship, which, critics said, led to erroneous conclusions.\"In 1995, the parapsychologist David Fontana proposed in an article that poltergeists could haunt tape recorders. He speculated that this may have happened to the parapsychologist Maurice Grosse who investigated the Enfield Poltergeist case. However, Tom Flynn a media expert for the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry examined Fontana\'s article and suggested an entirely naturalistic explanation for the phenomena. According to the skeptical investigator Joe Nickell \"Occasionally, especially with older tape and under humid conditions, as the tape travels it can adhere to one of the guide posts. When this happens on a deck where both supply and take-up spindles are powered, the tape continues to feed, creating a fold. It was such a loop of tape, Flynn theorizes, that threaded its way amid the works of Grosse\'s recorder.\"In 1997, Imants Barušs, of the Department of Psychology at the University of Western Ontario, conducted a series of experiments using the methods of EVP investigator Konstantin Raudive, and the work of \"instrumental transcommunication researcher\" Mark Macy, as a guide. A radio was tuned to an empty frequency, and over 81 sessions a total of 60 hours and 11 minutes of recordings were collected. During recordings, a person either sat in silence or attempted to make verbal contact with potential sources of EVP. Barušs stated that he did record several events that sounded like voices, but they were too few and too random to represent viable data and too open to interpretation to be described definitively as EVP. He concluded: \"While we did replicate EVP in the weak sense of finding voices on audio tapes, none of the phenomena found in our study was clearly anomalous, let alone attributable to discarnate beings. Hence we have failed to replicate EVP in the strong sense.\" The findings were published in the Journal of Scientific Exploration in 2001, and include a literature review.In 2005, the Journal of the Society for Psychical Research published a report by paranormal investigator Alexander MacRae.  MacRae conducted recording sessions using a device of his own design that generated EVP.\nIn an attempt to demonstrate that different individuals would interpret EVP in the recordings the same way, MacRae asked seven people to compare some selections to a list of five phrases he provided, and to choose the best match. MacRae said the results of the listening panels indicated that the selections were of paranormal origin.Portable digital voice recorders are currently the technology of choice for some EVP investigators. Since some of these devices are very susceptible to Radio Frequency (RF) contamination, EVP enthusiasts sometimes try to record EVP in RF- and sound-screened rooms.Some EVP enthusiasts describe hearing the words in EVP as an ability, much like learning a new language.  Skeptics suggest that the claimed instances may be misinterpretations of natural phenomena, inadvertent influence of the electronic equipment by researchers, or deliberate influencing of the researchers and the equipment by third parties. EVP and ITC are seldom researched within the scientific community, so most research in the field is carried out by amateur researchers who lack training and resources to conduct scientific research, and who are motivated by subjective notions.\n\n\n== Explanations and origins ==\nParanormal claims for the origin of EVP include living humans imprinting thoughts directly on an electronic medium through psychokinesis and communication by discarnate entities such as spirits, nature energies, beings from other dimensions, or extraterrestrials. Paranormal explanations for EVP generally assume production of EVP by a communicating intelligence through means other than the typical functioning of communication technologies. Natural explanations for reported instances of EVP tend to dispute this assumption explicitly and provide explanations which do not require novel mechanisms that are not based on recognized scientific phenomena.\nOne study, by psychologist Imants Barušs, was unable to replicate suggested paranormal origins for EVP recorded under controlled conditions. Brian Regal in Pseudoscience: A Critical Encyclopedia (2009) has written \"A case can be made for the idea that many EVPs are artifacts of the recording process itself with which the operators are unfamiliar. The majority of EVPS have alternative, nonspiritual sources; anomalous ones have no clear proof they are of spiritual origin.\"\n\n\n=== Natural explanations ===\nThere are a number of simple scientific explanations that can account for why some listeners to the static on audio devices may believe they hear voices, including radio interference and the tendency of the human brain to recognize patterns in random stimuli. Some recordings may be hoaxes created by frauds or pranksters.\n\n\n==== Psychology and perception ====\nAuditory pareidolia is a situation created when the brain incorrectly interprets random patterns as being familiar patterns. In the case of EVP it could result in an observer interpreting random noise on an audio recording as being the familiar sound of a human voice. The propensity for an apparent voice heard in white noise recordings to be in a language understood well by those researching it, rather than in an unfamiliar language, has been cited as evidence of this, and a broad class of phenomena referred to by author Joe Banks as Rorschach Audio has been described as a global explanation for all manifestations of EVP.Skeptics such as David Federlein, Chris French, Terence Hines and Michael Shermer say that EVP are usually recorded by raising the \"noise floor\" – the electrical noise created by all electrical devices – in order to create white noise.  When this noise is filtered, it can be made to produce noises which sound like speech.  Federlein says that this is no different from using a wah pedal on a guitar, which is a focused sweep filter which moves around the spectrum and creates open vowel sounds.  This, according to Federlein, sounds exactly like some EVP.  This, in combination with such things as cross modulation of radio stations or faulty ground loops can cause the impression of paranormal voices.  The human brain evolved to recognize patterns, and if a person listens to enough noise the brain will detect words, even when there is no intelligent source for them.  Expectation also plays an important part in making people believe they are hearing voices in random noise.Apophenia is related to, but distinct from pareidolia. Apophenia is defined as \"the spontaneous finding of connections or meaning in things which are random, unconnected or meaningless\", and has been put forward as a possible explanation. According to the psychologist James Alcock what people hear in EVP recordings can best be explained by apophenia, cross-modulation or expectation and wishful thinking. Alcock concluded \"Electronic Voice Phenomena are the products of hope and expectation; the claims wither away under the light of scientific scrutiny.\"\n\n\n==== Physics ====\nInterference, for example, is seen in certain EVP recordings, especially those recorded on devices which contain RLC circuitry. These cases represent radio signals of voices or other sounds from broadcast sources. Interference from CB Radio transmissions and wireless baby monitors, or anomalies generated through cross modulation from other electronic devices, are all documented phenomena. It is even possible for circuits to resonate without any internal power source by means of radio reception.Capture errors are anomalies created by the method used to capture audio signals, such as noise generated through the over-amplification of a signal at the point of recording.Artifacts created during attempts to boost the clarity of an existing recording might explain some EVP.  Methods include re-sampling, frequency isolation, and noise reduction or enhancement, which can cause recordings to take on qualities significantly different from those that were present in the original recording.The very first EVP recordings may have originated from the use of tape recording equipment with poorly aligned erasure and recording heads, resulting in the incomplete erasure of previous audio recordings on the tape. This could allow a small percentage of previous content to be superimposed or mixed into a new \'silent\' recording.\n\n\n==== Sporadic meteors and meteor showers ====\nFor all radio transmissions above 30 MHz (which are not reflected by the ionosphere) there is a possibility of meteor reflection of the radio signal. Meteors leave a trail of ionised particles and electrons as they pass through the upper atmosphere (a process called ablation) which reflect transmission radio waves which would usually flow into space. These reflected waves are from transmitters which are below the horizon of the received meteor reflection.  In Europe this means the brief scattered wave may carry a foreign voice which can interfere with radio receivers.  Meteor reflected radio waves last between 0.05 seconds and 1 second, depending on the size of the meteor.\n\n\n== Organizations that show interest in EVP ==\nThere are a number of organizations dedicated to studying EVP and instrumental transcommunication, or which otherwise express interest in the subject. Individuals within these organizations may participate in investigations, author books or journal articles, deliver presentations, and hold conferences where they share experiences.  In addition organizations exist which dispute the validity of the phenomena on scientific grounds.The Association TransCommunication (ATransC), formerly the American Association of Electronic Voice Phenomena (AA-EVP), and the International Ghost Hunters Society conduct ongoing investigations of EVP and ITC including collecting examples of purported EVP available over the internet. The Rorschach Audio Project, initiated by sound artist Joe Banks, which presents EVP as a product of radio interference combined with auditory pareidolia and the Interdisciplinary Laboratory for Biopsychocybernetics Research, a non-profit organization dedicated to studying anomalous phenomena related to neurophysiological conditions. According to the AA-EVP it is \"the only organized group of researchers we know of specializing in the study of ITC\".Parapsychologists and Spiritualists have an ongoing interest in EVP. Many Spiritualists experiment with a variety of techniques for spirit communication which they believe provide evidence of the continuation of life.  According to the National Spiritualist Association of Churches, \"An important modern day development in mediumship is spirit communications via an electronic device. This is most commonly known as Electronic Voice Phenomena (EVP)\".  An informal survey by the organization\'s Department Of Phenomenal Evidence cites that 1/3 of churches conduct sessions in which participants seek to communicate with spirit entities using EVP.The James Randi Educational Foundation offers a million dollars for proof that any phenomena, including EVP, are caused paranormally.\n\n\n== Cultural impact ==\nThe concept of EVP has influenced popular culture. It is popular as an entertaining pursuit, as in ghost hunting, and as a means of dealing with grief. It has influenced literature, radio, film, television, and music.\n\n\n=== Groups ===\nInvestigation of EVP is the subject of hundreds of regional and national groups and Internet message boards. Paranormal investigator John Zaffis claims, \"There\'s been a boom in ghost hunting ever since the Internet took off.\" Investigators, equipped with electronic gear—like EMF meters, video cameras, and audio recorders—scour reportedly haunted venues, trying to uncover visual and audio evidence of ghosts. Many use portable recording devices in an attempt to capture EVP.\n\n\n=== Films ===\nFilms involving EVP include Poltergeist, The Sixth Sense, and White Noise. It has also been featured on television series like Ghost Whisperer, The Omega Factor, A Haunting, Ghost Hunters, MonsterQuest, Ghost Adventures, The Secret Saturdays, Fact or Faked: Paranormal Files, Supernatural, Derren Brown Investigates, and Ghost Lab.\n\n\n=== TV and radio ===\nCoast To Coast AM hosts George Noory and Art Bell have explored the topic of EVP with featured guests such as Brendan Cook and Barbara McBeath of the Ghost Investigators Society, and paranormal investigator and \'demonologist\' Lou Gentile.\nThe Spirit of John Lennon, a pay-per-view seance broadcast in 2006, in which TV crew members, a psychic, and an \"expert in paranormal activity\" claim the spirit of former Beatle John Lennon made contact with them through what was described as \"an Electronic Voice Phenomenon (EVP).\"\nThe Doctor Who episode Dark Water features a fictional facility which was allegedly based on this principle.\n\n\n=== Novels ===\nLegion, a 1983 novel by William Peter Blatty, contains a subplot where Dr. Vincent Amfortas, a terminally ill neurologist, leaves a \"to-be-opened-upon-my-death\" letter for Lt. Kinderman detailing his accounts of contact with the dead, including the doctor\'s recently deceased wife, Ann, through EVP recordings. Amfortas\' character and the EVP subplot do not appear in the film version of the novel, The Exorcist III, although in Kinderman\'s dream dead people are seen trying to communicate with the living by radio.\nIn Pattern Recognition, a 2003 novel by William Gibson, the main character\'s mother tries to convince her that her father is communicating with her from recordings after his death/disappearance in the September 11, 2001 attacks.\'\n\n\n=== Theater and music ===\nIn Nyctivoe a 2001 vampire-inspired play by Dimitris Lyacos the male character as well as his deceased companion are speaking from a recording device amidst a static/white noise background.\nIn With the people from the bridge, a 2014 play by Dimitris Lyacos based on the idea of the return of the dead, the voice of the female character NCTV is transmitted from a television monitor amidst a static/white noise background.\nEVP is the subject of Vyktoria Pratt Keating\'s song \"Disembodied Voices on Tape\" from her 2003 album Things that Fall from the Sky, produced by Andrew Giddings of Jethro Tull.\nLaurie Anderson\'s \"Example #22\", from her 1981 album Big Science, interposes spoken sentences and phrases in German with sung passages in English representing EVP.\nDuring the outro to \"Rubber Ring\" by The Smiths, a sample from an EVP recording is repeated. The phrase \"You are sleeping, you do not want to believe,\" is a \'translation\' of the \'spirit voices\' from a 1970s flexitape. The original recording is from the 1971 record which accompanied Raudive\'s book \'Breakthrough\', and which was re-issued as a flexi-disc in the 1980s free with The Unexplained magazine.\nBass Communion\'s 2004 album Ghosts on Magnetic Tape was inspired by EVP.The band Giles Corey, founded by Dan Barrett composed a song called \'Empty Churches\' which features track 2 called \'Raymond Cass\', track 36 called \'Justified Theft\' and track 38 called \'Tramping\' from the album An Introduction to EVP by The Ghost Orchid which features excerpts from different EVP experiments produced by many researchers, although most are unknown, some have been pointed out to be more known researchers who studied EVP recordings including Friedrich Jurgenson, Raymond Cass and Konstantin Raudive.\nIn 2017 in Poland was published music cd Katharsis (A Small Victory) of Teatr Tworzenia by Jarosław Pijarowski with background recorded used EVP recordings (second track - \"Katharsis – Pandemonium\").\n\n\n== See also ==\nParapsychology\nMediumship\nSpeech synthesis\nSpeech recognition\nBackward message\nGhost hunting\nReverse speech\nAuditory hallucination\nList of topics characterized as pseudoscience\n\n\n== References ==', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/White-noise.png');

(78, 'Apollo 11', 'Apollo 11 was the spaceflight that landed the first two people on the Moon.  Commander Neil Armstrong and lunar module pilot Buzz Aldrin, both American, landed the Apollo Lunar Module Eagle on July 20, 1969, at 20:17 UTC. Armstrong became the first person to step onto the lunar surface six hours later on July 21 at 02:56:15 UTC; Aldrin joined him 19 minutes later. They spent about two and a quarter hours together outside the spacecraft, and collected 47.5 pounds (21.5 kg) of lunar material to bring back to Earth. Command module pilot Michael Collins flew the command module Columbia alone in lunar orbit while they were on the Moon\'s surface. Armstrong and Aldrin spent 21.5 hours on the lunar surface before rejoining Columbia in lunar orbit.\nApollo 11 was launched by a Saturn V rocket from Kennedy Space Center on Merritt Island, Florida, on July 16 at 13:32 UTC, and was the fifth crewed mission of NASA\'s Apollo program. The Apollo spacecraft had three parts: a command module (CM) with a cabin for the three astronauts, and the only part that returned to Earth; a service module (SM), which supported the command module with propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water; and a lunar module (LM) that had two stages – a descent stage for landing on the Moon, and an ascent stage to place the astronauts back into lunar orbit.\nAfter being sent to the Moon by the Saturn V\'s third stage, the astronauts separated the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered lunar orbit. Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into Eagle and landed in the Sea of Tranquillity. The astronauts used Eagle\'s ascent stage to lift off from the lunar surface and rejoin Collins in the command module. They jettisoned Eagle before they performed the maneuvers that blasted them out of lunar orbit on a trajectory back to Earth. They returned to Earth and splashed down in the Pacific Ocean on July 24 after more than eight days in space.\nArmstrong\'s first step onto the lunar surface was broadcast on live TV to a worldwide audience. He described the event as \"one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind.\" Apollo 11 effectively ended the Space Race and fulfilled a national goal proposed in 1961 by President John F. Kennedy: \"before this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth.\"\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn the late 1950s and early 1960s, the United States was engaged in the Cold War, a geopolitical rivalry with the Soviet Union. On October 4, 1957, the Soviet Union launched Sputnik 1, the first artificial satellite. This surprise success fired fears and imaginations around the world. It demonstrated that the Soviet Union had the capability to deliver nuclear weapons over intercontinental distances, and challenged American claims of military, economic and technological superiority. This precipitated the Sputnik crisis, and triggered the Space Race. President Dwight D. Eisenhower responded to the Sputnik challenge by creating the  National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and initiating Project Mercury, which aimed to launch a man into Earth orbit. But on April 12, 1961, Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin became the first person in space, and the first to orbit the Earth. It was another body blow to American pride. Nearly a month later, on May 5, 1961, Alan Shepard became the first American in space, completing a 15-minute suborbital journey. After being recovered from the Atlantic Ocean, he received a congratulatory telephone call from Eisenhower\'s successor, John F. Kennedy.\nKennedy believed that it was in the national interest of the United States to be superior to other nations, and that the perception of American power was at least as important as the actuality. It was therefore intolerable that the Soviet Union was more advanced in the field of space exploration. He was determined that the United States should compete, and sought a challenge that maximized its chances of winning. Since the Soviet Union had better booster rockets, he required a challenge that was beyond the capacity of the existing generation of rocketry, one where the US and Soviet Union would be starting from a position of equality. Something spectacular, even if it could not be justified on military, economic or scientific grounds. After consulting with his experts and advisors, he chose such a project. On May 25, 1961, he addressed the United States Congress on \"Urgent National Needs\" and declared:I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the Earth. No single space project in this period will be more impressive to mankind, or more important for the long-range exploration of space; and none will be so difficult or expensive to accomplish. We propose to accelerate the development of the appropriate lunar space craft. We propose to develop alternate liquid and solid fuel boosters, much larger than any now being developed, until certain which is superior. We propose additional funds for other engine development and for unmanned explorations-explorations which are particularly important for one purpose which this nation will never overlook: the survival of the man who first makes this daring flight. But in a very real sense, it will not be one man going to the Moon-if we make this judgment affirmatively, it will be an entire nation. For all of us must work to put him there.\nThe effort to land a man on the Moon already had a name: Project Apollo. An early and crucial decision was choosing lunar orbit rendezvous over both direct ascent and Earth orbit rendezvous. A space rendezvous is an orbital maneuver in which two spacecraft navigate through space and meet up. On July 11, 1962, James Webb announced the decision to use lunar orbit rendezvous. This resulted in a much smaller launch vehicle, and in the Apollo spacecraft being composed of three major parts: a command module (CM) with a cabin for the three astronauts, and the only part that returned to Earth; a service module (SM), which supported the command module with propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water; and a lunar module (LM) that had two stages – a descent stage for landing on the Moon, and an ascent stage to place the astronauts back into lunar orbit. This choice of mode meant that the spacecraft could be launched by a single Saturn V rocket that was then under development.Technologies and technics required for Apollo were developed by Project Gemini. Project Apollo was abruptly halted by the Apollo 1 fire on January 27, 1967, in which three astronauts died, and the subsequent investigation. In October 1968, Apollo 7 evaluated the command module in Earth orbit, and in December Apollo 8 tested it in lunar orbit. In March 1969, Apollo 9 put the lunar module through its paces in Earth orbit, and in May Apollo 10 conducted a \"dress rehearsal\" in lunar orbit. By July 1969, all was in readiness for Apollo 11 to take the final step onto the Moon.The Soviet Union competed with the US in the Space Race, but its early lead was lost through repeated failures in development of the N1 launcher, which was comparable to the Saturn V. The Soviets tried to beat the US to return lunar material to the Earth by means of unmanned probes. On July 13, three days before Apollo 11\'s launch, the Soviet Union launched Luna 15, which reached lunar orbit before Apollo 11. During descent, a malfunction caused Luna 15 to crash in Mare Crisium about two hours before Armstrong and Aldrin took off from the Moon\'s surface to begin their voyage home. The Nuffield Radio Astronomy Laboratories radio telescope in England recorded transmissions from Luna 15 during its descent, and these were released in July 2009 for the 40th anniversary of Apollo 11.\n\n\n== Personnel ==\n\n\n=== Prime crew ===\nThe initial crew assignment of Commander Neil Armstrong, Command Module Pilot (CMP) Jim Lovell, and Lunar Module Pilot (LMP) Buzz Aldrin on the backup crew for Apollo 9 was officially announced on November 20, 1967. Lovell and Aldrin had previously flown together as the crew of Gemini 12. Due to design and manufacturing delays in the LM, Apollo 8 and Apollo 9 swapped prime and backup crews, and Armstrong\'s crew became the backup for Apollo 8. Based on the normal crew rotation scheme, Armstrong was then expected to command Apollo 11.There would be one change. Michael Collins, the CMP on the Apollo 8 crew, began experiencing trouble with his legs. Doctors diagnosed the problem as a bony growth between his fifth and sixth vertebrae, requiring surgery. Lovell took his place on the Apollo 8 crew, and when Collins recovered he joined Armstrong\'s crew as CMP. In the meantime, Fred Haise filled in as backup LMP, and Aldrin as backup CMP for Apollo 8. Apollo 11 was the second American mission where all the crewmembers had prior spaceflight experience, the first being Apollo 10. The next was STS-26 in 1988.Slayton gave Armstrong the option to replace Aldrin with Lovell, since some thought Aldrin was difficult to work with. Armstrong had no issues working with Aldrin, but thought it over for a day before declining. He thought Lovell deserved to command his own mission (eventually Apollo 13).The Apollo 11 prime crew had none of the close cheerful camaraderie that characterized that of Apollo 12. Instead they forged an amiable working relationship. Armstrong in particular was notoriously aloof, but Collins, who considered himself a loner, confessed to rebuffing Aldrin\'s attempts to create a more personal relationship. Aldrin and Collins described the crew as \"amiable strangers\". Armstrong did not agree with the assessment, and said \"...all the crews I was on worked very well together.\"\n\n\n=== Backup crew ===\nThe backup crew consisted of Lovell as Commander, William Anders as CMP, and Haise as LMP. Anders had flown with Lovell on Apollo 8. In early 1969, he accepted a job with the National Aeronautics and Space Council effective August 1969, and announced that he would retire as an astronaut at that time. Ken Mattingly was moved from the support crew into parallel training with Anders as backup CMP in case Apollo 11 was delayed past its intended July launch date, at which point Anders would be unavailable. Lovell, Haise, and Mattingly were later assigned as the prime crew of Apollo 13.\n\n\n=== Support crew ===\nDuring Projects Mercury and Gemini, each mission had a prime and a backup crew. For Apollo, a third crew of astronauts was added, known as the support crew. The support crew maintained the flight plan, checklists and mission ground rules, and ensured that the prime and backup crews were apprised of changes. They developed procedures, especially those for emergency situations, so these were ready for when the prime and backup crews came to train in the simulators, allowing them to concentrate on practicing and mastering them. For Apollo 11, the support crew consisted of Ken Mattingly, Ronald Evans and Bill Pogue.\n\n\n=== Capsule communicators ===\n\nThe capsule communicator (CAPCOM) was an astronaut at the Mission Control Center in Houston, Texas, who was the only person who communicated directly with the flight crew. For Apollo 11, the CAPCOMs were: Charles Duke, Ronald Evans, Bruce McCandless II, James Lovell, William Anders, Ken Mattingly, Fred Haise, Don L. Lind, Owen K. Garriott and Harrison Schmitt.\n\n\n=== Flight directors ===\nThe four shift flight directors for this mission were:\nClifford E. Charlesworth (Green team), launch and extravehicular activity (EVA)\nGerald D. Griffin (Gold team)\nGene Kranz (White team), lunar landing\nGlynn Lunney (Black team), lunar ascent\n\n\n== Preparations ==\n\n\n=== Insignia ===\n\nThe Apollo 11 mission emblem was designed by Collins, who wanted a symbol for \"peaceful lunar landing by the United States\". At Lovell\'s suggestion, he chose the bald eagle, the national bird of the United States, as the symbol. Tom Wilson, a simulator instructor, suggested that they put an olive branch in its beak to represent their peaceful mission. Collins added a lunar background with the Earth in the distance. The sunlight in the image was coming from the wrong direction; the shadow should have been in the lower part of the Earth instead of the left. Aldrin, Armstrong and Collins decided that the Eagle and the Moon would be in their natural colours, and decided on a blue and gold border. Armstrong was concerned that \"eleven\" would not be understood by non-English speakers, so they went with \"Apollo 11\", and they decided not to put their names on the patch, so it would \"be representative of everyone who had worked toward a lunar landing\".An illustrator at the MSC did the artwork, which was then sent off to NASA officials for approval. The design was rejected. Bob Gilruth, the director of the MSC felt that the talons of the eagle looked \"too warlike\". After some discussion, the olive branch was moved to the talons. When the Eisenhower dollar coin was released in 1971, the patch design provided the eagle for its reverse side. The design was also used for the smaller Susan B. Anthony dollar unveiled in 1979.\n\n\n=== Call signs ===\nAfter the crew of Apollo 10 named their spacecraft Charlie Brown and Snoopy, assistant manager for public affairs Julian Scheer wrote to George M. Low, the  Manager of the Apollo Spacecraft Program Office at the Manned Spacecraft Center (MSC), to suggest the Apollo 11 crew be less flippant in naming their craft. The name Snowcone was used for the CM and Haystack was used for the LM in both internal and external communications during early mission planning.The LM was named Eagle after the motif which was featured prominently on the mission insignia. At Scheer\'s suggestion, the CM was named Columbia after  Columbiad, the giant cannon that launched a spacecraft (also from Florida) in Jules Verne\'s 1865 novel From the Earth to the Moon. It also referenced Columbia, a historical name of the United States.  In Collins\' 1976 book, he said Columbia was in reference to Christopher Columbus.\n\n\n=== Mementos ===\n\nThe astronaut had personal preference kits (PPKs), small bags containing personal items of significance that they wanted to take with them on the mission. Five 0.5-pound (0.23 kg) PPKs were carried on Apollo 11: three (one for each astronaut) were stowed on Columbia before launch, and two on Eagle.Neil Armstrong\'s LM PPK contained a piece of wood from the Wright brothers\' 1903 Wright Flyer\'s left propeller and a piece of fabric from its wing, along with a diamond-studded astronaut pin originally given to Deke Slayton by the widows of the Apollo 1 crew. This pin had been intended to be flown on that mission and given to Slayton afterwards; but following the disastrous launch pad fire and subsequent funerals, the widows gave the pin to Slayton. Armstrong took it with him on Apollo 11.\n\n\n=== Site selection ===\n\nNASA\'s Apollo Site Selection Board announced five potential landing sites on February 8, 1968. These were the result of two years\' worth of studies based on high-resolution photography of the lunar surface by the five unmanned probes of the Lunar Orbiter program and information about surface conditions provided by the Surveyor program. The best Earth-bound telescopes could not resolve features with the resolution Project Apollo required. The landing site had to be close to the lunar equator to minimize the amount of propellant required; clear of obstacles to minimize maneuvering, and flat to simplify the task of the landing radar. Scientific value was not a consideration.Areas that appeared promising on photographs taken on Earth were often found to be totally unacceptable. The original requirement that the site be free of craters had to be relaxed, as no such site was found. Five sites were considered: Sites 1 and 2 were in the Sea of Tranquility (Mare Tranquilitatis); Site 3 was in the Central Bay (Sinus Medii); and Sites 4 and 5 were in the Ocean of Storms (Oceanus Procellarum).\nThe final site selection was based on seven criteria:\n\nThe site needed to be smooth, with relatively few craters;\nwith approach paths free of large hills, tall cliffs or deep craters that might confuse the landing radar and cause it to issue incorrect readings;\nreachable with a minimum amount of propellant;\nallowing for delays in the launch countdown;\nproviding the Apollo spacecraft with a free-return trajectory, one that would allow it to coast around the Moon and safely return to Earth without requiring any engine firings should a problem arise on the way to the Moon;\nwith good visibility during the landing approach, meaning that the Sun would be between 7 and 20 degrees behind the LM; and\na general slope of less than 2 degrees in the landing area.The requirement for the Sun angle was particularly restrictive, limiting the launch date to one day per month. A landing just after dawn was chosen to limit the temperature extremes the astronauts would experience. The Apollo Site Selection Board selected Site 2, with Sites 3 and 5 as backups in the event of the launch being delayed. In May 1969, Apollo 10\'s lunar module flew to within 15 kilometers (9.3 mi) of Site 2, and reported that it was acceptable.\n\n\n=== First step decision ===\nDuring the first press conference after the Apollo 11 crew was announced, the first question a reporter asked was, \"Which one of you gentlemen will be the first man to step onto the lunar surface?\" Slayton told the reporter that it had not been decided, and Armstrong added that it was \"not based on individual desire\".One of the first versions of the egress checklist had the lunar module pilot exit the spacecraft before the command module pilot, which matched what had been done in previous missions. The commander had never performed the spacewalk. Reporters wrote in early 1969 that Aldrin would be the first to walk on the Moon, and Associate Administrator George Mueller told reporters he would be the first as well. Aldrin heard that Armstrong would be the first to step on the Moon because Armstrong was a civilian, which made Aldrin livid. Aldrin attempted to persuade other lunar module pilots he should be first, but they responded cynically about what they perceived as a lobbying campaign. Attempting to stem interdepartmental conflict, Slayton told Aldrin that Armstrong would be first since he was the commander. The decision was announced in a press conference on April 14, 1969.For decades, Aldrin believed the final decision was largely driven by the lunar module\'s hatch location. Because the astronauts had their spacesuits on and the spacecraft was so small, maneuvering to exit the spacecraft was difficult. The crew tried a simulation in which Aldrin left the spacecraft first, but he damaged the simulator while attempting to egress. While this was enough for mission planners to make their decision, Aldrin and Armstrong were left in the dark on the decision until late spring. Slayton told Armstrong the plan was to have him leave the spacecraft first, if he agreed. Armstrong said, \"Yes, that’s the way to do it.\"The media accused Armstrong of exercising his commander\'s prerogative to exit the spacecraft first. Chris Kraft revealed in his 2001 autobiography that a meeting occurred between Gilruth, Slayton, Low, and himself to make sure Aldrin would not be the first to walk on the Moon. They argued that the first person to walk on the Moon should be like Charles Lindbergh, a calm and quiet person. They made the decision to change the flight plan so the commander was the first to egress from the spacecraft.\n\n\n=== Pre-launch ===\n\nThe ascent stage of lunar module LM-5 arrived at the Kennedy Space Center on January 8, 1969, followed by the descent stage four days later, and Command and Service Module CM-107 on January 23. There were several differences between LM-5 and Apollo 10\'s LM-4; LM-5 had a VHF radio antenna to facilitate communication with the astronauts during their EVA on the lunar surface; a lighter ascent engine; more thermal protection on the landing gear; and a package of scientific experiments known as the Early Apollo Scientific Experiments Package (EASEP). The only change in the configuration of the command module was the removal of some insulation from the forward hatch.  The command and service modules were mated on January 29, and moved from the Operations and Checkout Building to the Vehicle Assembly Building on April 14.The  S-IVB third stage of Saturn V AS-506 had arrived on January 18, followed by the S-II second stage on February 6, S-IC first stage on February 20, and the Saturn V Instrument Unit on February 27. At 1230 on May 20, the 5,443-tonne (5,357-long-ton; 6,000-short-ton) assembly departed the Vehicle Assembly Building atop the crawler-transporter, bound for Launch Pad 39A, part of Launch Complex 39, while Apollo 10 was still on its way to the Moon. A countdown test commenced on June 26, and concluded on July 2. The launch complex was floodlit on the night of July 15, when the crawler-transporter carried the mobile service structure back to its parking area. In the early hours of the morning, the fuel tanks of the S-II and S-IVB stages were filled with liquid hydrogen. Fueling was completed by three hours before launch. Launch operations were partly automated, with 43 programs written in the ATOLL programming language.Slayton roused the crew shortly after 0400, and they showered, shaved, and had the traditional pre-flight breakfast of steak and eggs with Slayton and the backup crew. They then donned their space suits and began breathing pure oxygen. At 0630, they headed out to Launch Complex 39. Haise entered Columbia about three hours and ten minutes before launch time. Along with a technician, he helped Armstrong into the left hand couch at 06:54. Five minutes later, Collins joined him, taking up his position on the right hand couch. Finally, Aldrin entered, taking the center couch. Haise left around two hours and ten minutes before launch. The closeout crew sealed the hatch, and the cabin was purged and pressurized. The closeout crew then left the launch complex about an hour before launch time. The countdown became automated at three minutes and twenty seconds before launch time. Over 450 personnel were at the consoles in the firing room.\n\n\n== Mission ==\n\n\n=== Launch and flight to lunar orbit ===\n\nAn estimated one million spectators watched the launch of Apollo 11 from the highways and beaches in the vicinity of the launch site. Dignitaries included the Chief of Staff of the United States Army, General William Westmoreland, four cabinet members, 19 state governors, 40 mayors, 60 ambassadors and 200 congressmen. Vice President Spiro Agnew viewed the launch with the former president, Lyndon B. Johnson and his wife Lady Bird Johnson. Around 3,500 media representatives were present. About two-thirds were from the United States; the rest came from 55 other countries. The launch was televised live in 33 countries, with an estimated 25 million viewers in the United States alone. Millions more around the world listened to radio broadcasts. President Richard Nixon viewed the launch from his office in the White House with his NASA liaison officer, Apollo astronaut Frank Borman.Saturn V AS-506 launched Apollo 11 on July 16, 1969, at 13:32:00 UTC (9:32:00 EDT).  It entered Earth orbit at an altitude of 100.4 nautical miles (185.9 km) by 98.9 nautical miles (183.2 km), twelve minutes later. After one and a half orbits, the S-IVB third-stage engine pushed the spacecraft onto its trajectory toward the Moon with the trans-lunar injection (TLI) burn at 16:22:13 UTC. About 30 minutes later, with Collins in the left seat and at the controls, the transposition, docking, and extraction maneuver was performed. This involved separating Columbia from the spent S-IVB stage, turning around, and docking with Eagle still attached to the stage. After the LM was extracted, the combined spacecraft headed for the Moon, while the rocket stage flew on a trajectory past the Moon. This was done to avoid colliding with the spacecraft, the Earth, or the Moon. A slingshot effect from passing around the Moon threw it into an orbit around the Sun.On July 19 at 17:21:50 UTC, Apollo 11 passed behind the Moon and fired its service propulsion engine to enter lunar orbit. In the thirty orbits that followed, the crew saw passing views of their landing site in the southern Sea of Tranquillity about 12 miles (19 km) southwest of the crater Sabine D. The site was selected in part because it had been characterized as relatively flat and smooth by the automated Ranger 8 and Surveyor 5 landers and the Lunar Orbiter mapping spacecraft and unlikely to present major landing or EVA challenges. It lay about 25 kilometers (16 mi) southeast of the Surveyor 5 landing site, and 68 kilometers (42 mi) southwest of Ranger 8\'s crash site.\n\n\n=== Lunar descent ===\n\nAt 12:52:00 UTC on July 20, Aldrin and Armstrong entered Eagle, and began the final preparations for lunar descent. At 17:44:00 Eagle separated from Columbia. Collins, alone aboard Columbia, inspected Eagle as it pirouetted before him to ensure the craft was not damaged, and that the landing gear was correctly deployed. Armstrong exclaimed: \"The Eagle has wings!\"As the descent began, Armstrong and Aldrin found that they were passing landmarks on the surface two or three seconds early, and reported that they were \"long\"; they would land miles west of their target point. Eagle was traveling too fast. The problem could have been mascons—concentrations of high mass that could have altered the trajectory. Flight Director Gene Kranz speculated that it could have resulted from extra air pressure in the docking tunnel. Or it could have been the result of Eagle\'s pirouette maneuver.Five minutes into the descent burn, and 6,000 feet (1,800 m) above the surface of the Moon, the LM guidance computer (LGC) distracted the crew with the first of several unexpected 1201 and 1202 program alarms. Inside Mission Control Center, computer engineer Jack Garman told Guidance Officer Steve Bales it was safe to continue the descent, and this was relayed to the crew. The program alarms indicated \"executive overflows\", meaning the guidance computer could not complete all of its tasks in real time and had to postpone some of them. Margaret Hamilton, the Director of Apollo Flight Computer Programming at the MIT Charles Stark Draper Laboratory later recalled:\n\nTo blame the computer for the Apollo 11 problems is like blaming the person who spots a fire and calls the fire department. Actually, the computer was programmed to do more than recognize error conditions. A complete set of recovery programs was incorporated into the software. The software\'s action, in this case, was to eliminate lower priority tasks and re-establish the more important ones. The computer, rather than almost forcing an abort, prevented an abort. If the computer hadn\'t recognized this problem and taken recovery action, I doubt if Apollo 11 would have been the successful Moon landing it was.\nDuring the mission, the cause was diagnosed as the rendezvous radar switch being in the wrong position, causing the computer to process data from both the rendezvous and landing radars at the same time. Software engineer Don Eyles concluded in a 2005 Guidance and Control Conference paper that the problem was due to a hardware design bug previously seen during testing of the first unmanned LM in Apollo 5. Having the rendezvous radar on (so that it was warmed up in case of an emergency landing abort) should have been irrelevant to the computer, but an electrical phasing mismatch between two parts of the rendezvous radar system could cause the stationary antenna to appear to the computer as dithering back and forth between two positions, depending upon how the hardware randomly powered up. The extra spurious cycle stealing, as the rendezvous radar updated an involuntary counter, caused the computer alarms.\n\n\n=== Landing ===\n\nWhen Armstrong again looked outside, he saw that the computer\'s landing target was in a boulder-strewn area just north and east of a 300-foot (91 m) diameter crater (later determined to be West crater), so he took semi-automatic control. Armstrong considered landing short of the boulder field so they could collect geological samples from it, but could not since their horizontal velocity was too fast. Throughout the descent, Aldrin called out navigation data to Armstrong, who was busy piloting Eagle. Now 107 feet (33 m) above the surface, Armstrong knew their propellant supply was dwindling and was determined to land at the first possible landing site.Armstrong found a clear patch of ground and maneuvered the spacecraft towards it. As he got closer, now 250 feet (76 m) above the surface, he discovered his new landing site had a crater in it. He cleared the crater and found another patch of level ground. They were now 100 feet (30 m) from the surface, with only 90 seconds of propellant remaining. Lunar dust kicked up by the LM\'s engines began to obfuscate his ability to determine the spacecraft\'s motion. Some large rocks jutted out of the dust cloud, and Armstrong focused on them during his descent so he could determine the spacecraft\'s speed.A few moments before the landing, a light informed Aldrin that at least one of the 67-inch (170 cm) probes hanging from Eagle\'s footpads had touched the surface, and he said: \"Contact light!\" Armstrong was supposed to immediately shutdown the engines, as the engineers suspected the pressure caused by the engines own exhaust reflecting off the lunar surface could make them explode, but forgot. Three seconds later, Eagle landed and Armstrong shutdown the engines. Aldrin immediately said \"Okay, engine stop. ACA – out of detent.\" Armstrong acknowledged: \"Out of detent. Auto.\" Aldrin continued: \"Mode control – both auto. Descent engine command override off. Engine arm – off. 413 is in.\"\n\nACA was the attitude control assembly, the LM\'s control stick. Output went to the LGC to command the reaction control system (RCS) jets to fire. \"Out of Detent\" meant that the stick had moved away from its centered position; it was spring-centered like the turn indicator in a car. LGC address 413 contained the variable that indicated that the LM had landed.Eagle landed at 20:17:40 UTC on Sunday July 20 with about 25 seconds of fuel left. Apollo 11 landed with less fuel than subsequent missions, and the astronauts encountered a premature low fuel warning. This was later found to be the result of greater propellant \'slosh\' than expected, uncovering a fuel sensor. On subsequent missions, extra anti-slosh baffles were added to the tanks to prevent this.Armstrong acknowledged Aldrin\'s completion of the post landing checklist with \"Engine arm is off\", before responding to the CAPCOM, Charles Duke, with the words, \"Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed.\" Armstrong\'s unrehearsed change of call sign from \"Eagle\" to \"Tranquility Base\" emphasized to listeners that landing was complete and successful. Duke mispronounced his reply as he expressed the relief at Mission Control: \"Roger, Twan— Tranquility, we copy you on the ground. You got a bunch of guys about to turn blue. We\'re breathing again. Thanks a lot.\"\n\nTwo and a half hours after landing, before preparations began for the EVA, Aldrin radioed to Earth:\n\nThis is the LM pilot. I\'d like to take this opportunity to ask every person listening in, whoever and wherever they may be, to pause for a moment and contemplate the events of the past few hours and to give thanks in his or her own way.\nHe then took communion privately. At this time NASA was still fighting a lawsuit brought by atheist Madalyn Murray O\'Hair (who had objected to the Apollo 8 crew reading from the Book of Genesis) demanding that their astronauts refrain from broadcasting religious activities while in space. As such, Aldrin chose to refrain from directly mentioning taking communion on the Moon. Aldrin was an elder at the Webster Presbyterian Church, and his communion kit was prepared by the pastor of the church, Dean Woodruff. Webster Presbyterian possesses the chalice used on the Moon and commemorates the event each year on the Sunday closest to July 20. The schedule for the mission called for the astronauts to follow the landing with a five-hour sleep period, but they chose to begin the preparations for the EVA early, thinking that they would be unable to sleep.\n\n\n=== Lunar surface operations ===\n\nPreparations for the EVA began at 23:43. These took longer than expected; three and a half hours instead of two. During training on Earth, everything required had been neatly laid out in advance, but on the Moon the cabin contained a large number of other items as well, such as checklists, food packets and tools. Once Armstrong and Aldrin were ready to go outside, Eagle was depressurized. The hatch was opened at 02:39:33. Armstrong initially had some difficulties squeezing through the hatch with his portable life support system (PLSS). Some of the highest heart rates recorded from Apollo astronauts occurred during LM egress and ingress. At 02:51 Armstrong began his descent to the lunar surface. The remote control unit controls on his chest kept him from seeing his feet. Climbing down the nine-rung ladder, Armstrong pulled a D-ring to deploy the modular equipment stowage assembly (MESA) folded against Eagle\'s side and activate the TV camera.Apollo 11 used slow-scan television (TV) incompatible with broadcast TV, so it was displayed on a special monitor and a conventional TV camera viewed this monitor, significantly reducing the quality of the picture. The signal was received at Goldstone in the United States, but with better fidelity by Honeysuckle Creek Tracking Station near Canberra in Australia. Minutes later the feed was switched to the more sensitive Parkes radio telescope in Australia. Despite some technical and weather difficulties, ghostly black and white images of the first lunar EVA were received and broadcast to at least 600 million people on Earth. Copies of this video in broadcast format were saved and are widely available, but recordings of the original slow scan source transmission from the lunar surface were likely destroyed during routine magnetic tape re-use at NASA.\n\nWhile still on the ladder, Armstrong uncovered a plaque mounted on the LM descent stage bearing two drawings of Earth (of the Western and Eastern Hemispheres), an inscription, and signatures of the astronauts and President Nixon. The inscription read:\n\nHere men from the planet Earth first set foot upon the Moon, July 1969 A.D. We came in peace for all mankind.\nAfter describing the surface dust as \"very fine-grained\" and \"almost like a powder\", at 02:56:15, six and a half hours after landing, Armstrong stepped off Eagle\'s footpad and declared: \"That\'s one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind.\"Armstrong intended to say \"That\'s one small step for a man\", but the word \"a\" is not audible in the transmission, and thus was not initially reported by most observers of the live broadcast. When later asked about his quote, Armstrong said he believed he said \"for a man\", and subsequent printed versions of the quote included the \"a\" in square brackets. One explanation for the absence may be that his accent caused him to slur the words \"for a\" together; another is the intermittent nature of the audio and video links to Earth, partly because of storms near Parkes Observatory. More recent digital analysis of the tape claims to reveal the \"a\" may have been spoken but obscured by static.About seven minutes after stepping onto the Moon\'s surface, Armstrong collected a contingency soil sample using a sample bag on a stick. He then folded the bag and tucked it into a pocket on his right thigh. This was to guarantee there would be some lunar soil brought back in case an emergency required the astronauts to abandon the EVA and return to the LM. Twelve minutes after the sample was collected, he removed the TV camera from the MESA and made a panoramic sweep, then mounted it on a tripod. The TV camera cable remained partly coiled and presented a tripping hazard throughout the EVA. Still photography was accomplished with a Hasselblad camera which could be operated hand held or mounted on Armstrong\'s Apollo/Skylab A7L space suit. Aldrin joined Armstrong on the surface. He described the view with the simple phrase: \"Magnificent desolation.\"Armstrong said that moving in the lunar gravity, one-sixth of Earth\'s, was \"even perhaps easier than the simulations ... It\'s absolutely no trouble to walk around.\" Aldrin joined him on the surface and tested methods for moving around, including two-footed kangaroo hops. The PLSS backpack created a tendency to tip backward, but neither astronaut had serious problems maintaining balance. Loping became the preferred method of movement. The astronauts reported that they needed to plan their movements six or seven steps ahead. The fine soil was quite slippery. Aldrin remarked that moving from sunlight into Eagle\'s shadow produced no temperature change inside the suit, but the helmet was warmer in sunlight, so he felt cooler in shadow. The MESA failed to provide a stable work platform and was in shadow, slowing work somewhat. As they worked, the moonwalkers kicked up gray dust which soiled the outer part of their suits.\n\nThe astronauts planted the Lunar Flag Assembly containing a flag of the United States on the lunar surface, in clear view of the TV camera. Aldrin remembered, \"Of all the jobs I had to do on the Moon the one I wanted to go the smoothest was the flag raising.\" But the astronauts struggled with the telescoping rod and could only jam the pole a couple of inches (5 cm) into the hard lunar surface. Aldrin was afraid it might topple in front of TV viewers. But he gave \"a crisp West Point salute\". Before Aldrin could take a photo of Armstrong with the flag, President Richard Nixon spoke to them through a telephone-radio transmission which Nixon called \"the most historic phone call ever made from the White House.\" Nixon originally had a long speech prepared to read during the phone call, but Frank Borman, who was at the White House as a NASA liaison during Apollo 11, convinced Nixon to keep his words brief.\nNixon: Hello, Neil and Buzz. I\'m talking to you by telephone from the Oval Room at the White House. And this certainly has to be the most historic telephone call ever made. I just can\'t tell you how proud we all are of what you\'ve done. For every American, this has to be the proudest day of our lives. And for people all over the world, I am sure they too join with Americans in recognizing what an immense feat this is. Because of what you have done, the heavens have become a part of man\'s world. And as you talk to us from the Sea of Tranquillity, it inspires us to redouble our efforts to bring peace and tranquillity to Earth. For one priceless moment in the whole history of man, all the people on this Earth are truly one: one in their pride in what you have done, and one in our prayers that you will return safely to Earth.\nArmstrong: Thank you, Mr. President. It\'s a great honor and privilege for us to be here, representing not only the United States, but men of peace of all nations, and with interest and curiosity, and men with a vision for the future. It\'s an honor for us to be able to participate here today.\n\nThey deployed the EASEP, which included a passive seismic experiment package used to measure moonquakes and a retroreflector array used for the lunar laser ranging experiment. Then Armstrong walked 196 feet (60 m) from the LM to snap photos at the rim of Little West Crater  while Aldrin collected two core samples. He used the geologist\'s hammer to pound in the tubes – the only time the hammer was used on Apollo 11, but was unable to penetrate more than 6 inches (15 cm) deep. The astronauts then collected rock samples using scoops and tongs on extension handles. Many of the surface activities took longer than expected, so they had to stop documenting sample collection halfway through the allotted 34 minutes. Aldrin shoveled 6 kilograms (13 lb) of soil into the box of rocks in order to pack them in tightly. Two types of rocks were found in the geological samples: basalt and breccia. Three new minerals were discovered in the rock samples collected by the astronauts: armalcolite, tranquillityite, and pyroxferroite. Armalcolite was named after Armstrong, Aldrin, and Collins. All have subsequently been found on Earth.Mission Control used a coded phrase to warn Armstrong that his metabolic rates were high, and that he should slow down. He was moving rapidly from task to task as time ran out. As metabolic rates remained generally lower than expected for both astronauts throughout the walk, Mission Control granted the astronauts a 15-minute extension. In a 2010 interview, Armstrong explained that NASA limited the first moonwalk\'s time and distance because there was no empirical proof of how much cooling water the astronauts\' PLSS backpacks would consume to handle their body heat generation while working on the Moon.\n\n\n=== Lunar ascent ===\nAldrin entered Eagle first. With some difficulty the astronauts lifted film and two sample boxes containing 21.55 kilograms (47.5 lb) of lunar surface material to the LM hatch using a flat cable pulley device called the Lunar Equipment Conveyor (LEC). This proved to be an inefficient tool, and later missions preferred to carry equipment and samples up to the LM by hand. Armstrong reminded Aldrin of a bag of memorial items in his sleeve pocket, and Aldrin tossed the bag down. Armstrong then jumped onto the ladder\'s third rung, and climbed into the LM. After transferring to LM life support, the explorers lightened the ascent stage for the return to lunar orbit by tossing out their PLSS backpacks, lunar overshoes, an empty Hasselblad camera, and other equipment. The hatch was closed again at 05:01. They then pressurized the LM and settled down to sleep.\n\nNixon\'s speech writer William Safire had prepared In Event of Moon Disaster for the President to read on television in the event the Apollo 11 astronauts were stranded on the Moon. The contingency plan originated in a memo from Safire to Nixon\'s White House Chief of Staff H. R. Haldeman, in which Safire suggested a protocol the administration might follow in reaction to such a disaster. According to the plan, Mission Control would \"close down communications\" with the LM, and a clergyman would \"commend their souls to the deepest of the deep\" in a public ritual likened to burial at sea. The last line of the prepared text contained an allusion to Rupert Brooke\'s First World War poem, \"The Soldier\".While moving inside the cabin, Aldrin accidentally damaged the circuit breaker that would arm the main engine for lift off from the Moon. There was a concern this would prevent firing the engine, stranding them on the Moon. A felt-tip pen was sufficient to activate the switch; had this not worked, the LM circuitry could have been reconfigured to allow firing the ascent engine.After more than ​21 1⁄2 hours on the lunar surface, in addition to the scientific instruments, the astronauts left behind an Apollo 1 mission patch and a memorial bag containing a gold replica of an olive branch as a traditional symbol of peace and a silicon message disk. The disk carries the goodwill statements by Presidents Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon and messages from leaders of 73 countries around the world. The disk also carries a listing of the leadership of the US Congress, a listing of members of the four committees of the House and Senate responsible for the NASA legislation, and the names of NASA\'s past and present top management.\n\nAfter about seven hours of rest, the crew was awakened by Houston to prepare for the return flight. Two and a half hours later, at 17:54:00 UTC, they lifted off in Eagle\'s ascent stage to rejoin Collins aboard Columbia in lunar orbit. Film taken from the LM ascent stage upon liftoff from the Moon reveals the American flag, planted some 25 feet (8 m) from the descent stage, whipping violently in the exhaust of the ascent stage engine. Aldrin looked up in time to witness the flag topple: \"The ascent stage of the LM separated ... I was concentrating on the computers, and Neil was studying the attitude indicator, but I looked up long enough to see the flag fall over.\" Subsequent Apollo missions usually planted the American flags further from the LM to prevent them being blown over by the ascent engine exhaust.\n\n\n=== Columbia in lunar orbit ===\nDuring his day flying solo around the Moon, Collins never felt lonely. Although it has been said \"not since Adam has any human known such solitude\", Collins felt very much a part of the mission. In his autobiography he wrote: \"this venture has been structured for three men, and I consider my third to be as necessary as either of the other two\". In the 48 minutes of each orbit when he was out of radio contact with the Earth while Columbia passed round the far side of the Moon, the feeling he reported was not fear or loneliness, but rather \"awareness, anticipation, satisfaction, confidence, almost exultation\".One of Collins\' first tasks was to identify the lunar module on the ground. To give Collins an idea where to look, Mission Control radioed that they believed the lunar module landed about four miles off target. Each time he passed over the suspected lunar landing site, he tried in vain to find the module. On his first orbits on the back side of the Moon, Collins performed maintenance activities such as dumping excess water produced by the fuel cells and preparing the cabin for Armstrong and Aldrin to return.Just before he reached the dark side on the third orbit, Mission Control informed Collins that there was a problem with the temperature of the coolant. If it became too cold, parts of Columbia might freeze. Mission Control advised him to assume manual control and implement Environmental Control System Malfunction Procedure 17. Instead, Collins flicked the switch on the offending system from automatic to manual and back to automatic again, and carried on with normal housekeeping chores, while keeping an eye on the temperature. When Columbia came back around to the near side of the Moon again, he was able to report that the problem had been resolved. For the next couple of orbits, he described his time on the back side of the Moon as \"relaxing\". After Aldrin and Armstrong completed their EVA, Collins slept so he could be rested for the rendezvous. While the flight plan called for Eagle to meet up with Columbia, Collins was prepared for certain contingencies in which he would fly Columbia down to meet Eagle.\n\n\n=== Return ===\n\nEagle rendezvoused with Columbia at 21:24 UTC on July 21, and the two docked at 21:35. Eagle\'s ascent stage was jettisoned into lunar orbit at 23:41. Just before the Apollo 12 flight, it was noted that Eagle was still likely to be orbiting the Moon. Later NASA reports mentioned that Eagle\'s orbit had decayed, resulting in it impacting in an \"uncertain location\" on the lunar surface.\nOn July 23, the last night before splashdown, the three astronauts made a television broadcast in which Collins commented: ... The Saturn V rocket which put us in orbit is an incredibly complicated piece of machinery, every piece of which worked flawlessly ... We have always had confidence that this equipment will work properly. All this is possible only through the blood, sweat, and tears of a number of people ... All you see is the three of us, but beneath the surface are thousands and thousands of others, and to all of those, I would like to say, \"Thank you very much.\"\nAldrin added: This has been far more than three men on a mission to the Moon; more, still, than the efforts of a government and industry team; more, even, than the efforts of one nation. We feel that this stands as a symbol of the insatiable curiosity of all mankind to explore the unknown ... Personally, in reflecting on the events of the past several days, a verse from Psalms comes to mind. \"When I consider the heavens, the work of Thy fingers, the Moon and the stars, which Thou hast ordained; What is man that Thou art mindful of him?\"\nArmstrong concluded: The responsibility for this flight lies first with history and with the giants of science who have preceded this effort; next with the American people, who have, through their will, indicated their desire; next with four administrations and their Congresses, for implementing that will; and then, with the agency and industry teams that built our spacecraft, the Saturn, the Columbia, the Eagle, and the little EMU, the spacesuit and backpack that was our small spacecraft out on the lunar surface. We would like to give special thanks to all those Americans who built the spacecraft; who did the construction, design, the tests, and put their hearts and all their abilities into those craft. To those people tonight, we give a special thank you, and to all the other people that are listening and watching tonight, God bless you. Good night from Apollo 11.\"\nOn the return to Earth, a bearing at the Guam tracking station failed, potentially preventing communication on the last segment of the Earth return. A regular repair was not possible in the available time but the station director, Charles Force, had his ten-year-old son Greg use his small hands to reach into the housing and pack it with grease. Greg was later thanked by Armstrong.\n\n\n=== Splashdown and quarantine ===\n\nThe aircraft carrier USS Hornet, under the command of Captain Carl J. Seiberlich, was selected as the primary recovery ship (PRS) for Apollo 11 on June 5, replacing its sister ship, the LPH USS Princeton, which had recovered Apollo 10 on May 26. Hornet was then at her home port of Long Beach, California. On reaching Pearl Harbor on July 5, Hornet embarked the Sikorsky SH-3 Sea King helicopters of HS-4, a unit which specialized in recovery of Apollo spacecraft, specialized divers of UDT Detachment Apollo, a 35-man NASA recovery team, and about 120 media representatives. To make room, most of Hornet\'s air wing was left behind in Long Beach. Special recovery equipment was also loaded, including a boilerplate command module used for training.On July 12, with Apollo 11 still on the launch pad, Hornet departed Pearl Harbor for the recovery area in the central Pacific, in the vicinity of 10°36′N 172°24′E. A presidential party consisting of Nixon, Borman, Secretary of State William P. Rogers and National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger flew to Johnston Atoll on Air Force One, then to the command ship USS Arlington in  Marine One. After a night on board, they would fly to Hornet in Marine One for a few hours of ceremonies. On arrival aboard Hornet, the party was greeted by the  Commander-in-Chief, Pacific Command (CINCPAC), Admiral John S. McCain Jr., and NASA Administrator Thomas O. Paine, who flew to Hornet from Pago Pago in one of Hornet\'s carrier onboard delivery aircraft.Weather satellites were not yet common, but US Air Force Captain Hank Brandli had access to top secret spy satellite images. He realized that a storm front was headed for the Apollo recovery area. Poor visibility was a serious threat to the mission; if the helicopters could not locate Columbia, the spacecraft, its crew, and its priceless cargo of Moon rocks might be lost. Brandli alerted Navy Captain Willard S. Houston Jr., the commander of the Fleet Weather Center at Pearl Harbor, who had the required security clearance. On their recommendation, Rear Admiral Donald C. Davis, the commander of Manned Spaceflight Recovery Forces, Pacific, advised NASA to change the recovery area. This was done; a new one was designated, 215 nautical miles (398 km) northeast of the original.This altered the flight plan. A different sequence of computer programs was used, one never before attempted. In a conventional entry, P64 was followed by P67. For a skip-out re-entry, P65 and P66 were employed to handle the exit and entry parts of the skip. In this case, because they were extending the re-entry but not actually skipping out, P66 was not invoked and instead P65 led directly to P67. The crew were also warned that they would not be in a full-lift (heads-down) attitude when they entered P67. The first program\'s acceleration subjected the astronauts to 6.5 standard gravities (64 m/s2); the second, to 6.0 standard gravities (59 m/s2).Before dawn on July 24, Hornet launched four Sea King helicopters and three Grumman E-1 Tracers. Two of the E-1s were designated as \"air boss\" while the third acted as a communications relay aircraft. Two of the Sea Kings carried divers and recovery equipment. The third carried photographic equipment, and the fourth carried the decontamination swimmer and the flight surgeon. At 16:44 UTC (05:44 local time) Columbia\'s drogue parachutes were deployed. This was observed by the helicopters. Seven minutes later Columbia struck the water forcefully 2,660 km (1,440 nmi) east of Wake Island, 380 km (210 nmi) south of Johnston Atoll, and 24 km (13 nmi) from Hornet, at 13°19′N 169°9′W. During splashdown, Columbia landed upside down but was righted within ten minutes by flotation bags activated by the astronauts. A diver from the Navy helicopter hovering above attached a sea anchor to prevent it from drifting. More divers attached flotation collars to stabilize the module and positioned rafts for astronaut extraction.\n\nThe divers then passed biological isolation garments (BIGs) to the astronauts, and assisted them into the life raft. The possibility of bringing back pathogens from the lunar surface was considered remote, but NASA took precautions at the recovery site. The astronauts were rubbed down with a sodium hypochlorite solution and Columbia wiped with Betadine to remove any lunar dust that might be present. The astronauts were winched on board the recovery helicopter. BIGs were worn until they reached isolation facilities on board Hornet. The raft containing decontamination materials was intentionally sunk.After touchdown on Hornet at 17:53 UTC, the helicopter was lowered by the elevator into the hangar bay, where the astronauts walked the 30 feet (9.1 m) to the Mobile Quarantine Facility (MQF), where they would begin the Earth-based portion of their 21 days of quarantine. This practice would continue for two more Apollo missions, Apollo 12 and Apollo 14, before the Moon was proven to be barren of life, and the quarantine process dropped. Nixon welcomed the astronauts back to Earth. He told them: \"As a result of what you\'ve done, the world has never been closer together before.\"After Nixon departed, Hornet was brought alongside the 5-short-ton (4.5 t) Columbia, which was lifted aboard by the ship\'s crane, placed on a dolly and moved next to the MQF. It was then attached to the MQF with a flexible tunnel, allowing the lunar samples, film, data tapes and other items to be removed. Hornet returned to Pearl Harbor, where the MQF was loaded onto a Lockheed C-141 Starlifter and airlifted to the Manned Spacecraft Center. The astronauts arrived at the Lunar Receiving Laboratory at 10:00 UTC on July 28. Columbia was taken to Ford Island for deactivation, and its pyrotechnics made safe. It was then taken to Hickham Air Force Base, from whence it was flown to Houston in a Douglas C-133 Cargomaster, reaching the Lunar Receiving Laboratory on July 30.In accordance with the Extra-Terrestrial Exposure Law, a set of regulations promulgated by NASA on July 16 to codify its quarantine protocol, the astronauts continued in quarantine. After three weeks in confinement (first in the Apollo spacecraft, then in their trailer on Hornet, and finally in the Lunar Receiving Laboratory), the astronauts were given a clean bill of health. On August 10, 1969, the Interagency Committee on Back Contamination met in Atlanta and lifted the quarantine on the astronauts, on those who had joined them in quarantine (NASA physician William Carpentier and MQF project engineer John Hirasaki), and on Columbia itself. Loose equipment from the spacecraft remained in isolation until the lunar samples were released for study.\n\n\n=== Celebrations ===\n\nOn August 13, the three astronauts rode in parades in their honor in New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles. On the same evening in Los Angeles there was an official state dinner to celebrate the flight, attended by members of Congress, 44 governors, the Chief Justice of the United States, and ambassadors from 83 nations at the Century Plaza Hotel. Nixon and Agnew honored each astronaut with a presentation of the Presidential Medal of Freedom.This celebration was the beginning of a 45-day \"Giant Leap\" tour that brought the astronauts to 25 foreign countries and included visits with prominent leaders such as Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom. Many nations honored the first human Moon landing with special features in magazines or by issuing Apollo 11 commemorative postage stamps or coins.On September 16, 1969, the three astronauts spoke before a joint session of Congress. They presented two US flags, one to the House of Representatives and the other to the Senate, that had been carried to the surface of the Moon with them.  The flag of American Samoa on Apollo 11 is on display at the Jean P. Haydon Museum in Pago Pago, the capital of American Samoa.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\n\n\n=== Cultural significance ===\nHumans walking on the Moon and returning safely to Earth accomplished Kennedy\'s goal set eight years earlier. In Mission Control during the Apollo 11 landing, Kennedy\'s speech flashed on the screen, followed by the words \"TASK ACCOMPLISHED, July 1969\". The success of Apollo 11 demonstrated the United States\' technological superiority over other nations. With the success of Apollo 11, America had won the Space Race.New phrases permeated into the English language. \"If they can send a man to the Moon, why can\'t they...\" became a common saying following Apollo 11. Armstrong\'s famous words on the lunar surface also spun off countless parodies.While most celebrated the accomplishment, disenfranchised Americans saw it as a symbol of the divide in America, evidenced by protesters outside of Kennedy Space Center the day before Apollo 11 launched. This is not to say that they were not awed by it. Ralph Abernathy, leading a protest march, was so captivated by the spectacle of the Apollo 11 launch that he forgot what he was going to say. Racial and financial inequalities frustrated citizens who wondered why money spent on the Apollo program was not spent taking care of humans on Earth. A poem by Gil Scott-Heron called \"Whitey on the Moon\" illustrated the racial inequality in the United States that was highlighted by the Space Race. The poem starts with:\n\nTwenty percent of the world\'s population watched humans walk on the Moon for the first time. While Apollo 11 sparked the interest of the world, the follow-on Apollo missions did not hold the interest of the nation. One possible explanation was the shift in complexity. Landing someone on the Moon was an easy goal to understand; lunar geology was too abstract for the average person. Another is that Kennedy\'s goal of landing humans on the Moon had already been accomplished. A well-defined objective helped Project Apollo accomplish its goal, but after it was completed it was hard to justify continuing the lunar missions.While most Americans were proud of their nation\'s achievements in space exploration, only once during the late 1960s did the Gallup Poll indicate that a majority of Americans favored \"doing more\" in space as opposed to \"doing less\". By 1973, 59 percent of those polled favored cutting spending on space exploration. The Space Race had ended, and Cold War tensions were easing as the US and Soviet Union entered the era of détente. This was also a time when inflation was rising, which put pressure on the government to reduce spending. What saved the space program was that it was one of the few government program that had achieved something great. Drastic cuts, warned Caspar Weinberger, the deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget, might send a signal that \"our best years are behind us\".After the Apollo 11 mission, officials from the Soviet Union said that landing humans on the Moon was dangerous and unnecessary. At the time the Soviet Union was attempting to retrieve lunar samples robotically. The Soviets publicly denied there was a race to the Moon, and indicated that they were not making an attempt. Mstislav Keldysh said in July 1969 that, \"We are concentrating wholly on the creation of large satellite systems\". It was revealed in 1989 that the Soviets had tried to send people to the Moon, but were unable to due to technological difficulties. The public\'s reaction in the Soviet Union was mixed. The Soviet government limited the release of information about the lunar landing, which affected the reaction. A portion of the populace did not give it any attention, and another portion was angered by it.\n\n\n=== Spacecraft ===\n\nThe Command Module Columbia went on a tour of the United States, visiting 49 state capitals, the District of Columbia, and Anchorage, Alaska. In 1971, it was transferred to the Smithsonian Institute, and was displayed at the National Air and Space Museum (NASM) in Washington, DC. It was in the central Milestones of Flight exhibition hall in front of the Jefferson Drive entrance, sharing the main hall with other pioneering flight vehicles such as the Wright Flyer, Spirit of St. Louis, Bell X-1, North American X-15 and Friendship 7.Columbia was moved in 2017 to the NASM Mary Baker Engen Restoration Hangar at the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center in Chantilly, Virginia, to be readied for a four-city tour titled Destination Moon: The Apollo 11 Mission. This included Space Center Houston from October 14, 2017 to March 18, 2018, the Saint Louis Science Center from April 14 to September 3, 2018, the Senator John Heinz History Center in Pittsburgh from September 29, 2018 to February 18, 2019, and the Seattle Museum of Flight from March 16 to September 2, 2019.For 40 years Armstrong\'s and Aldrin\'s space suits were displayed in the museum\'s Apollo to the Moon exhibit, until it closed for good on December 3, 2018, to be replaced by a new gallery which was scheduled to open in 2022. A special display of Armstrong\'s suit is planned for the 50th anniversary of Apollo 11 in July 2019. The quarantine trailer, the flotation collar and the flotation bags are in the Smithsonian\'s Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center annex near Washington Dulles International Airport in Chantilly, Virginia, where they are on display along with a test lunar module.\n\nThe descent stage of the LM Eagle remains on the Moon. In 2009, the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) imaged the various Apollo landing sites on the surface of the Moon, for the first time with sufficient resolution to see the descent stages of the lunar modules, scientific instruments, and foot trails made by the astronauts. The remains of the ascent stage lie at an unknown location on the lunar surface, after being abandoned and impacting the Moon. The location is uncertain because Eagle ascent stage was not tracked after it was jettisoned, and the lunar gravity field is sufficiently non-uniform to make the orbit of the spacecraft unpredictable after a short time.In March 2012 a team of specialists financed by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos located the F-1 engines from the S-IC stage that launched Apollo 11 into space. They were found on the Atlantic seabed using advanced sonar scanning. His team brought parts of two of the five engines to the surface. In July 2013, a conservator discovered a serial number under the rust on one of the engines raised from the Atlantic, which NASA confirmed was from Apollo 11.\nThe S-IVB third stage which performed Apollo 11\'s trans-lunar injection remains in a solar orbit near to that of Earth.\n\n\n=== Moon rocks ===\nThe main repository for the Apollo Moon rocks is the Lunar Sample Laboratory Facility at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. For safekeeping, there is also a smaller collection stored at White Sands Test Facility near Las Cruces, New Mexico. Most of the rocks are stored in nitrogen to keep them free of moisture. They are handled only indirectly, using special tools. Over 100 research laboratories around the world conduct studies of the samples, and approximately 500 samples are prepared and sent to investigators every year.In November 1969, Nixon asked NASA  to make up about 250 presentation Apollo 11 lunar sample displays for 135 nations, the fifty states of the United States and its possessions, and the United Nations. Each display included Moon dust from Apollo 11. The rice-sized particles were four small pieces of Moon soil weighing about 50 mg and were enveloped in a clear acrylic button about as big as a United States half dollar coin. This acrylic button magnified the grains of lunar dust. The Apollo 11 lunar sample displays were given out as goodwill gifts by Nixon in 1970.The Passive Seismic Experiment ran until the command uplink failed on August 25, 1969. The downlink failed on December 14, 1969.  As of  2018, the Lunar Laser Ranging experiment remains operational.\n\n\n=== 40th anniversary events ===\n\nOn July 15, 2009, Life.com released a photo gallery of previously unpublished photos of the astronauts taken by Life photographer Ralph Morse prior to the Apollo 11 launch. From July 16 to 24, 2009, NASA streamed the original mission audio on its website in real time 40 years to the minute after the events occurred. It is in the process of restoring the video footage and has released a preview of key moments. In July 2010, air-to-ground voice recordings and film footage shot in Mission Control during the Apollo 11 powered descent and landing was re-synchronized and released for the first time. The John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum set up an Adobe Flash website that rebroadcasts the transmissions of Apollo 11 from launch to landing on the Moon.On July 20, 2009, Armstrong, Aldrin, and Collins met with U.S. President Barack Obama at the White House. \"We expect that there is, as we speak, another generation of kids out there who are looking up at the sky and are going to be the next Armstrong, Collins, and Aldrin\", Obama said. \"We want to make sure that NASA is going to be there for them when they want to take their journey.\" On August 7, 2009, an act of Congress awarded the three astronauts a Congressional Gold Medal, the highest civilian award in the United States. The bill was sponsored by Florida Senator Bill Nelson and Florida Representative Alan Grayson.A group of British scientists interviewed as part of the anniversary events reflected on the significance of the Moon landing:\n\nIt was carried out in a technically brilliant way with risks taken ... that would be inconceivable in the risk-averse world of today ... The Apollo programme is arguably the greatest technical achievement of mankind to date ... nothing since Apollo has come close [to] the excitement that was generated by those astronauts – Armstrong, Aldrin and the 10 others who followed them.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n This article incorporates public domain material from websites or documents of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"Apollo 11 transcripts\" at Spacelog\n\"Magnificent Desolation: The Apollo 11 Moonwalk Pictures\" by Apollo Lunar Surface Journal contributor Joseph O\'Dea.

(79, 'The Flying Saucers Are Real', 'The Flying Saucers Are Real by Donald Keyhoe, was a ground-breaking book that investigated numerous encounters between United States Air Force fighters, personnel, and other aircraft, and UFOs  between 1947 and 1950.\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\nIt was printed in paperback by Gold Medal Books, in 1950, and sold for 25 cents. In December, 1949, prior to the publishing of the book, Keyhoe published an article by the same name in True magazine, with similar material. The book was a huge success and popularized many ideas in ufology that are still widely believed today.\nThe Flying Saucers Are Real is short — only 175 pages. It is referenced by footnotes, and cites a panoply of sources, including newspapers, magazines, Air Force records and press statements, and personal interviews. It is written in a dramatic, narrative style reminiscent of mystery novels and spy thrillers. (Keyhoe also wrote fiction in these genres.)\nKeyhoe contended that the Air Force was investigating these cases of close encounters, with a policy of concealing their existence from the public until 1949. He stated that this policy was then replaced by one of cautious, progressive revelation.\nKeyhoe further stated that Earth had been visited by extraterrestrials for two centuries, with the frequency of these visits increasing sharply after the first atomic weapon test in 1945.  Citing anecdotal evidence, he intimated the Air Force may have attained and adapted some aspect of the alien technology, its method of propulsion and perhaps its source of power.  He believed the Air Force or the United States federal government would eventually reveal these technologies to the public when the Soviet Union was no longer a threat.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\"Keyhoe\'s book Flying Saucers Are Real ... was the first influential attempt to promote the idea of \"flying saucers\" as alien spacecraft.\" A loose parody of Keyhoe\'s book and of reports of UFO sightings and alien abductions is The Flying Saucers Are Very Very Real (2016).\n\n\n== See also ==\nConspiracy theory\nClose encounter\nCircular wing\nFlying Saucers from Outer Space (also by Keyhoe)\n\n\n== Citations ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nFull text at sacred-texts.com\nDonald E.

Mr Tonning took a film where the objects were seen moving. The movie was analized by the ufological organization Ground Saucer Watch (GSW). According to the GSW: there is no evidence of a hoax; the motion of the objects was attributable to the camera movement caused by the photographer; there is a lack of reference points in the photos or video tape, so it is not possible to give a conclusive answer on the nature of the objects. Other experts identified the bright objects as Jupiter and Arcturus.\n\n\n== 2006 ==\nIn the evening of August 21, 2006, a strange light phenomenon was reported seen by many people in the sky all over northern Norway, from Finnsnes in Troms, to Bodø in Nordland. The bright, green, shining orb was traveling with great speed in night sky and was described by witnesses as much bigger than an aircraft. The police and coast guards were contacted by hundreds of people who saw the object. Some people believed, and the newspapers half-seriously claimed, that it was a UFO, and for a while it remained an unidentified flying object. A few days later, the phenomenon was explained to have been a bolide.\n\n\n== 2009 ==\n\nOn December 9, 2009, a bluish spiraling light is seen, filmed, and photographed over Norway.

(82, 'Mutual UFO Network', 'The Mutual UFO Network (MUFON) is a US-based non-profit organization based in the United States composed of civilian volunteers who study alleged UFO sightings.  It is one of the oldest and largest organizations of its kind, claiming more than 4,000 members worldwide with chapters and representatives in more than 43 countries and all 50 states.  In 2015, MUFON founded Mutual UFO Network University, an unaccredited online institution which seeks to train members to investigate UFO sightings.  The organization has been criticized for its focus on pseudoscience, and critics say its investigators fail to use the scientific method.\n\n\n== History ==\nMUFON, Inc. was originally established as the Midwest UFO Network on 31 May 1969, in Quincy, Illinois, by Allen R. Utke, Walter H. Andrus, Jr., John F. Schuessler, and others. Most of MUFON\'s early members were associated with the SKYLOOK newsletter of Stover, Missouri and the Aerial Phenomena Research Organization (APRO), formerly of Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin.  MUFON was renamed the Mutual UFO Network in 1973 because of its expansion to other states and internationally.In 2019 MUFON celebrated its 50th anniversary.\n\n\n== Operation ==\nMUFON is currently headquartered in Irvine, California, under the direction of Jan Harzan, with chapters in every U.S. state. The organization claims to have more than 4,000 members worldwide, with a majority of its membership base situated in the continental United States. It holds an annual international symposium and publishes the monthly MUFON UFO Journal. The group now has more than 500 field investigators, as well as specialized teams to investigate possible physical evidence of any extraterrestrial craft. The network trains volunteers to be investigators and teaches them how to interview witnesses, perform research, and how to draw conclusions from the evidence. Although investigators are not paid, they must pass both an exam based on a 265-page manual, and a background check.  MUFON\'s features a case management system on its website, produces a monthly UFO journal (print and on-line), provides investigator training, and hosts a web-based newsroom.  \n\n\n== Criticism ==\nAccording to science writer Sharon A. Hill, MUFON\'s focus is \"decidedly unscientific with talks on alien abduction, conspiracy theories, human-ET hybrids, hypnotic regression, and repressed memories\", and reflects \"a wide range of pseudoscience\". MUFON has been the subject of criticism for drifting away from their original \"nuts and bolts UFO investigation\" into \"bizarre conspiracy and exopolitics talk\". The organization receives large numbers of UFO reports every year; the qualifications of the amateur volunteers examining the reports, however, have been questioned. Hill wrote that MUFON\'s idea of scientific researchers \"appears to be people who are not scientists or propose fantastic, anti-science tales\".\n\n\n== Association with far-right viewpoints ==\nAn April 2018 article in Newsweek reported evidence of \"anti-immigrant, anti-trans, and anti-Muslim sentiments\" among MUFON officials, including J.

(83, 'Japan Air Lines flight 1628 incident', 'Japan Air Lines flight 1628 was a UFO incident that occurred on November 17, 1986 involving a Japanese Boeing 747-200F cargo aircraft. The aircraft was en route from Paris to Narita International Airport, near Tokyo, with a cargo of Beaujolais wine. On the Reykjavík to Anchorage section of the flight, at 17:11 over eastern Alaska, the crew first witnessed two unidentified objects to their left. These abruptly rose from below and closed in to escort their aircraft. Each had two rectangular arrays of what appeared to be glowing nozzles or thrusters, though their bodies remained obscured by darkness. When closest, the aircraft\'s cabin was lit up and the captain could feel their heat on his face. These two craft departed before a third, much larger disk-shaped object started trailing them. Anchorage Air Traffic Control obliged and requested an oncoming United Airlines flight to confirm the unidentified traffic, but when it and a military craft sighted JAL 1628 at about 17:51, no other craft could be distinguished. The sighting lasted 50 minutes ended in the vicinity of Mount Denali.\n\n\n== Observation ==\nOn November 17, 1986, the Japanese crew of a JAL Boeing 747 cargo freighter witnessed three unidentified objects after sunset, while flying over eastern Alaska. The objects seemed to prefer the cover of darkness to their left, and to avoid the brighter skies to their right. At least the first two of the objects were observed by all three crew members: Captain Kenju Terauchi (Japanese: 寺内謙寿), an ex-fighter pilot with more than 10,000 hours flight experience, in the cockpit\'s left-hand seat; co-pilot Takanori Tamefuji (為藤隆憲) in the right-hand seat; and flight engineer Yoshio Tsukuba (佃善雄).The routine cargo flight entered Alaska on auto-pilot, cruising at 565 mph (909 km/h) at an altitude of 35,000 ft (11,000 m). At 17:09, the Anchorage ATC advised a new heading towards Talkeetna, Alaska.\n\n\n=== Two objects ===\n\nAs soon as JAL 1628 straightened out of its turn, at 17:11, Captain Terauchi noticed two craft to his far left, and some 2,000 ft (610 m) below his altitude, which he assumed to be military aircraft. These were pacing his flight path and speed. At 17:18 or 17:19 the two objects abruptly veered to a position about 500 ft (150 m) or 1,000 ft (300 m) in front of the aircraft, assuming a stacked configuration.\nIn doing so they activated \"a kind of reverse thrust, and [their] lights became dazzlingly bright\". To match the speed of the aircraft from their sideways approach, the objects displayed what Terauchi described as a disregard for inertia: \"The thing was flying as if there was no such thing as gravity. It sped up, then stopped, then flew at our speed, in our direction, so that to us it [appeared to be] standing still. The next instant it changed course. ... In other words, the flying object had overcome gravity.\" The \"reverse thrust\" caused a bright flare for three to seven seconds, to the extent that captain Terauchi could feel the warmth of their glows.\nAir traffic control was notified at this point (at 17:19:15), who could not confirm any traffic in the indicated position. After three to five minutes the objects assumed a side-to-side configuration, which they maintained for another 10 minutes. They accompanied the aircraft with an undulating motion, and some back and forth rotation of the jet nozzles, which seemed to be under automatic control, causing them to flare with brighter or duller luminosity.\nEach object had a square shape, consisting of two rectangular arrays of what appeared to be glowing nozzles or thrusters, separated by a dark central section. Captain Terauchi speculated in his drawings, that the objects would appear cylindrical if viewed from another angle, and that the observed movement of the nozzles could be ascribed to the cylinders\' rotation. The objects left abruptly at about 17:23:13, moving to a point below the horizon to the east.\n\n\n=== Third object ===\n\nWhere the first objects disappeared, Captain Terauchi now noticed a pale band of light that mirrored their altitude, speed and direction. Setting their onboard radar scope to a 25 nautical miles (46 km) range, he confirmed an object in the expected 10 o\'clock direction at about 7.5 nmi (13.9 km) distance, and informed ATC of its presence. Anchorage found nothing on their radar, but Elmendorf\'s NORAD Regional Operations Control Center (ROCC), directly in his flight path, reported a \"surge primary return\" after some minutes.As the city lights of Fairbanks began to illuminate the object, captain Terauchi believed to perceive the outline of a gigantic spaceship on his port side that was \"twice the size of an aircraft carrier\". It was, however, outside first officer Tamefuji\'s field of view. The object followed \"in formation\", or in the same relative position throughout the 45 degree turn, a descent from 35,000 to 31,000 ft, and a 360 degree turn. The short-range radar at Fairbanks airport failed, however, to register the object.Anchorage ATC offered military intervention, which was declined by the pilot, due to his knowledge of the Mantell incident. The object was not noted by any of two planes which approached JAL 1628 to confirm its presence, by which time JAL 1628 had also lost sight of it. JAL 1628 arrived safely in Anchorage at 18:20.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nCaptain Terauchi cited in the official Federal Aviation Administration report that the object was a UFO. In December 1986, Terauchi gave an interview to two Kyodo News journalists. JAL soon grounded him for talking to the press, and moved him to a desk job. He was only reinstated as a pilot years afterwards, and retired eventually in north Kanto, Japan.Kyodo News contacted Paul Steucke, the FAA public information officer in Anchorage on December 24, and received confirmation of the incident, followed by UPI on the 29th. The FAA\'s Alaskan Region consulted John Callahan, the FAA Division Chief of the Accidents and Investigations branch, as they wanted to know what to tell the media about the UFO. John Callahan was unaware of any such incident, considering it a likely early flight of a stealth bomber, then in development. He asked the Alaskan Region to forward the relevant data to their technical center in Atlantic City, New Jersey, where he and his superior played back the radar data and tied it in with the voice tapes by videotaping the concurrent playbacks.A day later at FAA headquarters they briefed Vice Admiral Donald D. Engen, who watched the whole video of over half an hour, and asked them not to talk to anybody until they were given the OK, and to prepare an encompassing presentation of the data for a group of government officials the next day. The meeting was attended by representatives of the FBI, CIA and President Reagan’s Scientific Study Team, among others. Upon completion of the presentation, all present were told that the incident was secret and that their meeting \"never took place\". According to Callahan, the officials considered the data to represent the first instance of recorded radar data on a UFO, and they took possession of all the presented data. John Callahan however managed to retain the original video, the pilot\'s report and the FAA\'s first report in his office. The forgotten target print-outs of the computer data were also rediscovered, from which all targets can be reproduced that were in the sky at the time.After a three-month investigation, the FAA formally released their results at a press conference held on March 5, 1987. Here Paul Steucke retracted earlier FAA suggestions that their controllers confirmed a UFO, and ascribed it to a \"split radar image\" which appeared with unfortunate timing. He clarified that \"the FAA [did] not have enough material to confirm that something was there\", and though they were \"accepting the descriptions by the crew\" they were \"unable to support what they saw\". The McGrath incident was revealed here amongst the ample set of documents supplied to the journalists.\nThe sighting received special attention from the media, as a supposed instance of the tracking of UFOs on both ground and airborne radar, while being observed by experienced airline pilots, with subsequent confirmation by an FAA Division Chief.\n\n\n== Subsequent Alaskan sightings ==\n\n\n=== Alaska Airlines flight 53 UFO ===\nOn 29 January 1987 at 18:40, Alaska Airlines Flight 53 observed a fast moving object on their onboard weather radar. While at 35,000 ft (11,000 m), some 60 miles (97 km) west of McGrath, on a flight from Nome to Anchorage, the radar registered a strong target in their 12 o\'clock position, at 25 miles (40 km) range.\nWhile they could not distinguish any object or light visually, they noticed that the radar object was increasing its distance at a very high rate. With every sweep of their radar, about 1 second apart, the object added five miles to its distance, translating to a speed of 18,000 mph (29,000 km/h). The pilot however relayed a speed of \'a mile a second\' to the control tower, or a speed of 3,600 mph (5,800 km/h), but confirmed that the target exceeded both the 50 mi (80 km) and 100 mi (160 km) ranges of their radar scope in a matter of seconds. The object was outside the radar range of the Anchorage ARTCC, and additional radar data covering the specified time and location failed to substantiate the pilots\' claim.\n\n\n=== KC-135 observation ===\nA US Air Force KC-135 jet flying from Anchorage to Fairbanks once again observed a very large, disk-shaped object on January 30, 1987.  The pilot reported that the object was 12 m (40 ft) from the aircraft. The object then disappeared out of sight.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nThe incident was described on an episode of the documentary series The Unexplained Files, broadcast on Science Channel on 23 September 2014.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nLeslie Kean, 2010, UFOs: Generals, Pilots and Government Officials Go On the Record\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nPilot certain of UFO sightings Mohave Daily Miner\nUFO dwarfed jet, pilot says Ellensburg Daily Record', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c5/Airplane_silhouette.svg'),
(84, '1976 Tehran UFO incident', 'The 1976 Tehran UFO Incident dolat  was a radar and visual sighting of an unidentified flying object (UFO) over Tehran, the capital of Iran, during the early morning hours of 19 September 1976. During the incident, two Iranian Air Force F-4 Phantom II jet interceptors reported losing instrumentation and communications as they approached the object. These were restored upon withdrawal.\nOne of the aircraft also reported a temporary weapons systems failure while the crew was preparing to open fire.\n\n\n== Explanation and analysis ==\nAccording to Martin Bridgstock of Griffith University:\n  Stripped of details, a couple of F4 jets from the Iranian airforce were scrambled to investigate some sightings of lights in the sky. Reports vary, but at least one jet suffered grave  electrical  failures, tried to fire a  missile at something and had something fired at it. A nearby jet airliner also suffered radio failure.\n\nAccording to journalist Philip J. Klass, it was likely the pilots initially saw an astronomical body, probably Jupiter, an explanation also cited by aerospace researcher James Oberg. Klass wrote that pilot incompetence and equipment malfunction likely accounted for the reported equipment failures.According to Klass, the Westinghouse technician at Shahrokhi airbase stated that only the first F-4 reported failing equipment, and that this F-4 was known for equipment failures with a long history of electrical outages, having been repaired only a month before the incident. Klass cites a McDonnell Douglas repair supervisor\'s opinion that the F-4\'s radar could have been in \"manual track\" mode, causing a wrong interpretation of the radar lock.Bridgstock criticized UFOlogists reports as \"not a reliable account of the Iran UFO incident\" and summed up Klass\' conclusions:\nKlass found that only one aircraft had suffered electrical malfunctions, not two. What is more, that plane had had a history of unexplained electrical faults, and  the  electrical  workshop  responsible  for  it  was notorious  for  poor  performance. In this  context, a temporary  electrical  malfunction  can  hardly be characterised as mysterious. He also points out that the  aircrews  at  the  time  were  tired  and  rattled, and could have mistaken stars or meteors for UFOs and \"missiles\". In addition, Klass points out that radio faults on  airliners  are  not  unknown,  and  that  is  why  they carry backup radio sets.\n\nRegarding pilot reports of \"bright objects\" falling to the ground and \"leaving a bright trail\", author Brian Dunning observes that September 19, the day of the incident, was the height of two annual meteorite showers, the Gamma Piscids and the Southern Piscids and the tail of the Eta Draconids shower, so observation of falling objects or odd lights would not have been unusual. At the site where the falling light supposedly crashed, a beeping transponder from a C-141 aircraft was found according to investigating Col. Mooy.According to Dunning:\nOnce we look at all the story\'s elements without the presumption of an alien spaceship, the only thing unusual about the Tehran 1976 UFO case is that planes were chasing celestial objects and had equipment failures. There have been many cases where planes had equipment failures, and there have been many cases where planes misidentified celestial objects. Once in a while, both will happen on the same flight.\n\nDunning criticized UFOlogists and UFO-themed television programs like Sightings for describing all the events related to the incident \"from the context of a presumption that the light was a hostile and intelligently guided alien spacecraft\".\n\n\n== Reference to incident in the media ==\nThe Sightings TV program covered the incident in 1994, interviewing many of the participants.\nThe Telegraph\'s top 10 UFO sightings (#7).\nThe Guardian\'s top 10 UFO sightings (#10).\n\n\n== Gallery ==\nEditorial published in the United States Air Force Security Services quarterly MIJI (Meaconing, Intrusion, Jamming, and Interference) newsletter that is \"often waved by the UFOlogists as compelling evidence\". According to Brian Dunning, \"because this service requires a security clearance, their newsletter is protected as well. There is nothing especially interesting about the actual article; it\'s just a dramatized retelling of the same information in Col. Mooy\'s memo, offered in the newsletter as a curious editorial on the subject of jamming and interference.\"\n\n		\n		\n\n\n== See also ==\nUFO sightings in Iran\nList of UFO sightings\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Tehran UFO incident report at UfoSightingsToday.org\nDefence Intelligence Agency Report with Routing and Transmittal Slip\nDefense Intelligence Agency Report\nDunning, Brian (19 June 2012). \"Skeptoid #315: The Tehran 1976 UFO\".

The Carolingian  archbishop, Agobard of Lyons, described in his  De Grandine et Tonitruis (\"On Hail and Thunder\") of a \"certain region called Magonia from whence come ships in the clouds\", and how he prevented the stoning death of \"three men and a woman who said they had fallen from these same ships.\"  \n\n\n== 1952 ==\nOctober 17, 1952, Oloron-Sainte-Marie. Many people saw a cigar-shaped UFO accompanied by 30 disc-shaped objects. These smaller UFOs dropped a white siliceous cotton which covered tree branches and roofs. Some French skeptics thought that the UFOs were an optical phenomenon caused by the refraction of the sun\'s rays and the siliceous cotton was caused by a migration of field spiders.\n\n\n== 1954 ==\n\nOn September 10, 1954, a railway worker witnesses two small beings boarding a UFO and flying into the sky.

An alleged UFO sighting and close encounter by farmer Maurice Masse. According to Masse, he encountered two small beings near a spherical vehicle that had landed in a nearby field. Masse claims that he was paralyzed when one of the beings pointed a tube-like object towards him. Masse said he watched the beings looking at plants and making grunting sounds until they returned to the vehicle and flew away. According to his wife, Masse said he received some kind of communication from the beings, considered his encounter \"a spiritual experience\", and looked upon the site as \"hallowed ground\" that \"should be kept in his family forever\".

In the afternoon, the witness noted that two amaranth plants located near the UFO had withered leaves. The witness called the Gendarmerie, which made an inspection in the garden and took some samples of the amaranth plants. The analysis of the samples made by GEPAN found that the plants had been dehydrated, but there were no evidence of radiations.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of major UFO sightings\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCNES - UFO Data\nMUFON - Last 20 UFO Sightings and Pictures', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8d/Valensole_humanoid.png'),

In most cases, as the fictional story progresses, the Earth is being invaded by hostile alien forces from outer space, usually from Mars, as depicted in early science fiction, or the people are being destroyed by alien forces, as depicted in the film Independence Day. Some fictional UFO encounters may be based on real UFO reports, such as Night Skies. Night Skies is based on the 1997 Phoenix UFO Incident.\nUFOs appear in many forms of fiction other than film, such as video games in the Destroy All Humans! or the X-COM series and Halo series and print, The War of the Worlds or Iriya no Sora, UFO no Natsu. Typically a small group of people or the military (which one depending on where the film was made), will fight off the invasion, however the monster Godzilla has fought against many UFOs.\n\n\n== Books ==\nOahspe: A New Bible - John Ballou Newbrough - First book to use the word Starship long before science-fiction writers conceived of interstellar space travel (1882).\nThe War of the Worlds - H.

(88, 'Travis Walton UFO incident', 'The Travis Walton UFO incident was an alleged abduction of an American forestry worker by a UFO on November 5, 1975, while working in the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forests near Snowflake, Arizona. Walton reappeared after a five-day search. The Walton case received mainstream publicity and remains one of the best-known alien abduction stories. Skeptics consider it a hoax.\nWalton wrote a book about his purported abduction in 1978 called The Walton Experience, which was adapted into the film Fire in the Sky in 1993, written by Tracy Tormé.\n\n\n== Abduction claims ==\nAccording to Walton, on November 5, 1975 he was working with a timber stand improvement crew in the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest near Snowflake, Arizona. While riding in a truck with six of his coworkers, they encountered a saucer-shaped object hovering over the ground approximately 110 feet away, making a high-pitched buzz. Walton claims that after he left the truck and approached the object, a beam of light suddenly appeared from the craft and knocked him unconscious. The other six men were frightened and supposedly drove away. Walton claimed that he awoke in a hospital-like room, being observed by three short, bald creatures. He claimed that he fought with them until a human wearing a helmet led Walton to another room, where he blacked out as three other humans put a clear plastic mask over his face. Walton has claimed he remembers nothing else until he found himself walking along a highway, with the flying saucer departing above him.\n\n\n== Ufologists ==\nIn the days following Walton\'s UFO claim, The National Enquirer awarded Walton and his co-workers a $5,000 prize for \"best UFO case of the year\" after they allegedly passed polygraph tests administered by the Enquirer and the Aerial Phenomena Research Organization (APRO). Walton, his older brother, and his mother were described by the Navajo County, Arizona sheriff as \"longtime students of UFOs\". Some UFOlogists believe Walton was abducted by aliens. UFOlogist Jim Ledwith said, “For five days, the authorities thought he’d been murdered by his co-workers, and then he was returned. All of the co-workers who were there, who saw the spacecraft, they all took polygraph tests, and they all passed, except for one, and that one was inconclusive.”\n\n\n== Skeptical reception ==\nSkeptics consider the case to be a hoax, describing it as \"sensationalizing on the part of the media\" and \"a put-up job to make money.\" UFO researcher Philip J. Klass considered Walton\'s story to be a hoax perpetrated for financial gain, and discovered many \"discrepancies\" in the accounts of Walton and his co-workers. After investigating the case, Klass reported that the polygraph tests were \"poorly administered\", that Walton used \"polygraph countermeasures\" such as holding his breath, and uncovered an earlier failed test administered by an examiner who concluded the case involved \"gross deception\".Science and skepticism writer Michael Shermer criticized Walton\'s claims, saying, \"I think the polygraph is not a reliable determiner of truth. I think Travis Walton was not abducted by aliens. In both cases, the power of deception and self-deception is all we need to understand what really happened in 1975 and after.\" Cognitive psychologist Susan Clancy argues that alien abduction reports began only after stories of extraterrestrials appeared in films and on TV, and that Walton was likely influenced by the NBC television movie The UFO Incident that aired two weeks before his own claimed abduction and dramatized the alien abduction claims of Betty and Barney Hill. Clancy noted the rise in alien abduction claims following the movie and cites Klass\'s conclusions that \"after viewing this movie, any person with a little imagination could now become an instant celebrity\", concluding that \"one of those instant celebrities was Travis Walton.\"\n\n\n== Media and publicity ==\nIn 1978, Walton wrote the book The Walton Experience detailing his claims, which became the basis for the 1993 film Fire in the Sky. Paramount Pictures decided Walton’s account was \"too fuzzy and too similar to other televised close encounters,\" so they ordered screenwriter Tracy Tormé to write a \"flashier, more provocative\" abduction story. Walton has occasionally appeared at UFO conventions or on television. He sponsors his own UFO conference in Arizona, called the \"Skyfire Summit.\"Thirty years after the book\'s release, Walton appeared on the Fox game show The Moment of Truth and was asked if he in fact was abducted by a UFO on November 5, 1975, to which he replied with \"Yes\". The polygraph test determined he was lying. In 2016, Walton appeared in the twelfth season of the Travel Channel\'s Ghost Adventures, where he was interviewed by Zak Bagans. He also appeared in an episode of the Canadian series Evil Encounters, titled \"Terror From The Sky.\"\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of UFO sightings\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nTravis Walton\'s official website\nDunning, Brian (1 April 2008). \"Skeptoid #94: Fire in the Sky: A Real UFO Abduction?\".

(89, 'Lakenheath-Bentwaters incident', 'The Lakenheath-Bentwaters Incident was a series of radar and visual contacts with Unidentified flying objects (UFO) that took place over airbases in eastern England on the night of 13–14 August 1956, involving personnel from the Royal Air Force (RAF) and the United States Air Force (USAF). The incident has since gained some prominence in the literature of ufology and the popular media.The final Report of the Condon Committee, which otherwise concluded that UFOs were simple misidentifications of natural phenomena or aircraft, took an unusual position on the case: \"In conclusion, although conventional or natural explanations certainly cannot be ruled out, the probability of such seems low in this case and the probability that at least one genuine UFO was involved appears to be fairly high\". It has, however, also been argued that the incidents can be explained by false radar returns and misidentification of astronomical phenomena.\n\n\n== The incident ==\nThe commonly cited sequence of events is recorded in the original Project Blue Book file by the USAF, subsequently analysed by the Condon Committee\'s report and by atmospheric physicist James E. McDonald.\nThe incident began at the USAF-tenanted RAF Bentwaters, Suffolk,  on the evening of 13 August 1956. This was a dry, largely clear night with, observers noted, an unusually large number of shooting stars, associated with the Perseid meteor shower.\nAt 21:30, Radar operators at the base tracked a target, appearing similar to a normal aircraft return, approaching the base from the sea at an apparent speed of several thousand miles per hour. They also tracked a group of targets moving slowly to the north-east which merged into a single very large return (several times the strength of that from a B-36) before moving off the scope to the north, as well as a further rapid target proceeding from east to west.A T-33 trainer from the 512th Fighter Interceptor Squadron, crewed by 1st Lieutenants Charles Metz and Andrew Rowe, was directed to investigate the radar contacts, but saw nothing. No visual sightings of the objects were made from Bentwaters in this period with the exception of a single amber star-like object which was subsequently identified as probably being Mars, then low in the south-east.At 22:55, a target was detected approaching Bentwaters from the east at a speed estimated around 2000–4000 mph. It faded from the scope as it passed over the base (possibly suggesting anomalous propagation as a source for the target, although ground-based radars almost always have a blind spot overhead), reappearing to the west. However, as it passed overhead a rapidly moving white light was observed from the ground, while the pilot of a C-47 at 4000 feet over Bentwaters reported that a similar light had passed beneath his aircraft. At this point, Bentwaters alerted the U.S.-tenanted RAF Lakenheath base, 40 miles to the north-west, to look out for the targets. Ground personnel at Lakenheath made visual sightings of several luminous objects, including two which arrived, made a sharp change in course, and appeared to merge before moving off. The angular size of these objects was compared to that of a golf ball at arms length, and they were stated to dwindle to pinpoint size as they moved away, an observation which seemed to rule out a bolide or bright meteor.The final phase of the incident was described in some detail by Technical Sergeant Forrest Perkins, who was the Watch Supervisor in the Lakenheath Radar Air Traffic Control centre, and who wrote directly to the Condon Committee in 1968. Perkins claimed that two RAF De Havilland Venom interceptors were scrambled and directed towards a radar target near Lakenheath. The pilot of the first Venom achieved contact, but then found that the target manoeuvred behind him and chased the aircraft for a period of around 10 minutes despite the latter’s taking violent evasive action; Perkins characterised the pilot as \"getting worried, excited and also pretty scared\". The second Venom was forced to return to its home station due to engine problems; Perkins stated that the target remained on their screens for a short period before leaving on a northerly heading.\n\n\n== Investigation by the Condon Committee ==\nThe Condon Committee included the case in its analysis largely in response to Perkins\' letter. Aside from the Blue Book file, it was able to obtain a previous classified teleprinter message, transmitted three days after the incident, from 3910th Air Base Group to Air Defence Command at Ent AFB; the teleprinter message\'s description of the events, including the \'chase\' episode, largely agreed with that of Perkins.\nBased on the information available, the Committee\'s researcher (Thayer) felt that while anomalous propagation was possible, the lack of other targets on radar scopes at the time made it unlikely. Focusing on the later phase of the incident at Lakenheath, he came to the remarkable conclusion that \"this is the most puzzling and unusual case in the radar-visual files. The apparently rational, intelligent behavior of the UFO suggests a mechanical device of unknown origin as the most probable explanation of this sighting\".\n\nAviation journalist and noted UFO skeptic Philip J. Klass concluded, however, that the incident could be explained as a combination of false radar returns and misperceptions of meteors from the Perseid stream.\n\n\n== The account of Freddie Wimbledon and a further civilian witness ==\nLittle information emerged on the case until the late 1970s, when an article in the Daily Express, and a subsequent piece by astronomer Ian Ridpath in the Sunday Times, produced further witnesses. Flight Lieutenant Freddie Wimbledon wrote to the Sunday Times on 19 March 1978 contesting Ridpath\'s statement that the incident had effectively been explained by Klass.\nWimbledon had been the radar controller on duty at RAF Neatishead at the time of the sightings. While his account of events agreed with that of Perkins in some details, including the description of the aircraft being apparently chased by the object, he stated that it had in fact been his team who directed the two Venoms to the interception and that the U.S. personnel at Lakenheath would have been merely \'listening in\'. Wimbledon disagreed with Klass\' analysis, remembering the incident as involving a solid radar return tracked from three sets on the ground and one in the intercepting aircraft.\nThe same 1978 press interest in the case also elicited a letter from a John Killock to the Daily Express in which he claimed to have seen, in August 1956, both a single, rapidly traveling white light at Ely, along with a Venom, and subsequently an odd group of amber lights.\n\n\n== Recent research ==\nFour British Fortean researchers, Dr. David Clarke, Andy Roberts, Martin Shough, and Jenny Randles, have since conducted a study that has indicated that the incident, or incidents, were very much more complex than the Condon Report had suggested.\nMost significantly, the aircrews originally involved in the incident, Flying Officers David Chambers and John Brady from the first aircraft and Flying Officers Ian Fraser-Ker and Ivan Logan from the second, were located and interviewed. The aircrews involved all flew with 23 Squadron from RAF Waterbeach and were scrambled at 02:00 and 02:40 on 14 August – around two hours later than Wimbledon and Perkins claimed the interceptions occurred.\nIn contrast to the reports given in the original classified teleprinter message and in the accounts of both Wimbledon and Perkins, the aircrews both stated that the radar contacts obtained were unimpressive and that no \'tail-chase\', or action on the part of the target, occurred. They also asserted no visual contacts were made. The first pilot, Chambers, commented that \"my feeling is that there was nothing there, it was some sort of mistake\", while Ivan Logan, the second Venom\'s navigator, stated that \"all we saw was a blip which rather indicated a stationary target\". At the time 23 Squadron decided that the radar contact had, if anything, been with a weather balloon.\nTo add to the contradictory nature of the accounts collected, another Venom crew was traced who had been scrambled much earlier in the evening. Flying Officers Leslie Arthur and Grahame Scofield were not told of the nature of their target and were forced to return to base after the aircraft\'s wingtip fuel tanks malfunctioned; Scofield recalled listening in to the radio communications of the intercepting pilots while back at Waterbeach later in the evening. Scofield\'s account of the overheard radio transmissions agreed, puzzlingly, with those of Wimbledon and Perkins, though he felt able to identify the crews as Chambers / Brady and Fraser-Ker / Logan. The time and path of Scofield\'s flight was identified as one which could also convincingly explain the sighting of a Venom at Ely by the civilian, Killock, who had claimed to see anomalous lights.\nThe new research additionally revealed that 23 Squadron\'s Commanding Officer, Wing Commander (later Air Commodore) A. N. Davis, had also been diverted to investigate the radar returns while flying a Venom from RAF Coltishall. As the interception would have occurred at the same time as that described by Wimbledon and Perkins, it has been suggested that Davis and another pilot were the two described in their accounts.\n\n\n== See also ==\nRendlesham Forest incident\n\n\n== References ==', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e4/Perseid_meteor_2007.jpg'),
(90, 'USS Nimitz UFO incident', 'The USS Nimitz UFO incident refers to a 2004 radar-visual encounter of an unidentified flying object by US fighter pilots of the Nimitz Carrier Strike Group. In December 2017, infrared footage of the encounter was released to the public.A 2015 account of the incident on FighterSweep.com, interviews with one of the pilots, and subsequent news reports describe the sighting of an \"unidentified flying object\" by six Super Hornet fighter jets over the Pacific Ocean in November, 2004.According to The Washington Post, the video was released by former intelligence officer Luis Elizondo to shed light on a secretive Department of Defense operation to analyze reported UFO sightings, the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program.Skeptics have called into question the veracity of the pilots\' accounts, pointing out that the sighting could be explained by equipment malfunction or human error. On his part one of the witnesses, retired navy commander David Fravor, lamented the amount \"of misinformation that [was] starting to come out through third and fourth parties\" during a June 2018 interview.\n\n\n== Encounter ==\n\nPrior to the incident, early November 2004, the Ticonderoga-class guided missile cruiser USS Princeton, part of Carrier Strike Group 11, had been tracking mysterious aircraft intermittently for two weeks on an advanced AN/SPY-1B passive radar. Navy officer Kevin Day, stationed on the Princeton, recalls that he first noticed the clear radar traces of 8 to 10 objects around the 10th of November. They were travelling southwards in a loose though fixed formation at 28,000 ft in the immediate vicinity of Catalina Island. He was startled by their slow speed of 100 knots, but received confirmation of their presence from radar operators on other vessels. Regular observations were made of a similar number of objects over the following six days.\n\n\n=== Visual sighting ===\n\nWhen the same event occurred again around 9:30 PST on 14 November 2004, an operations officer aboard Princeton contacted two airborne U.S. Navy Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornets from USS Nimitz, flying a combat exercise at the time. The aircraft were two-seat variants, and each pilot was accompanied by a weapon systems officer (WSO). The lead Super Hornet was piloted by Commander David Fravor, commanding officer of Strike Fighter Squadron 41. The second fighter, flying as wingman, included Lieutenant commander Jim Slaight as one of the two officers aboard. Princeton\'s radio operator, Kevin Day, directly instructed the pilots to change their course and investigate the unidentified radar spot observed by Princeton\'s own radar. This was done to determine if the objects posed any collision danger to an upcoming air defense exercise. A female radio operator on the Princeton however asked the pilots if they were carrying operational weapons, and the pilots replied that they were not. The weather conditions for that day showed excellent visibility with a blue sky, no cloud cover, and a calm sea.\nWhen the jet fighters arrived on site, the crew of four saw nothing in the air nor on their radar. On the Princeton\'s radar however, it was noticed that the object now dropped from 28,000 ft to near sea level in less than a second. As the pilots looked down at the sea, they noticed a turbulent oval area of churning water with foam and frothy waves \"the size of a Boeing 737 airplane\" with a smoother area of lighter color at the center, as if the waves were breaking over something just under the surface. A few seconds later, they noticed an unusual object hovering with erratic movements 50 feet above the churning water. Both Fravor and Slaight later described the object as a large bright white Tic Tac 30 to 46 feet (10 to 14 meters) long, with no windshield nor porthole, no wing nor empennage, and no visible engine nor exhaust plume.Fravor began a circular descent to approach the object. As Fravor further descended, he reported that the object began ascending along a curved path, maintaining some distance from the F-18, mirroring its trajectory in opposite circles. Fravor then made a more aggressive maneuver, plunging his fighter to aim below the object, but at this point the UFO accelerated and went out of sight in less than two seconds, leaving the pilots \"pretty weirded out\".Subsequently, the two fighter jets began a new course to the combat air patrol (CAP) rendezvous point. \"Within seconds\" the Princeton radioed the jets that the radar target had reappeared 60 miles away at this predetermined rendezvous point. According to Popular Mechanics, a physical object would have had to move greater than 2,400 miles an hour to cover the distance in the reported time. Two other jets went to investigate the new radar location, but \"By the time the Super Hornets arrived [...] the object had already disappeared.\" Both F-18s then returned to Nimitz. Commander Fravor reflected on his sighting: \"I have no idea what I saw. It had no plumes, wings or rotors and outran our F-18s. But I want to fly one\".\n\n\n=== Infrared footage ===\n\nAfter the return of the first team to Nimitz, a second team took off at approximately 12:00 PST, this time equipped with an advanced infrared camera (FLIR pod). This camera recorded an evasive unidentified aerial system on video, publicly released by the Pentagon on 16 December 2017 alongside the revelation of the funding of the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program.This footage is known as the 2004 USS Nimitz FLIR1 video. It officially shed some light on a decade-old story that was largely unknown, except for a 2015 second-hand story on FighterSweep.com that, in spite of providing many details, remained unconfirmed at that time.A second infrared footage, known as the GIMBAL video, has been released by the Pentagon alongside the 2004 FLIR1 footage. Although the media often present the two videos together to illustrate the 2004 USS Nimitz UFO incident, the GIMBAL video is unrelated, filmed at the East Coast of the United States at an unknown date.\n\n\n== Skeptical analysis ==\nDefense and security writer Kyle Mizokami suggested three possibilities that could explain the sightings. The first is equipment malfunction or misinterpretation; USS Princeton\'s radars and the Super Hornets\' electro-optical sensors and radars could have all malfunctioned, or the crew could have misinterpreted a number of natural phenomena. The second is classified government technology: Uf the objects were aircraft operated by the United States government, it would make sense that they were kept secret, as the object easily outmaneuvered multiple Super Hornets, a jet that was considered state-of-the-art in 2004. The third possibility is that the sightings were caused by objects of extraterrestrial origin.The New York Times included a disclaimer in its reporting of the incident: \"Experts caution that earthly explanations often exist for such incidents, and that not knowing the explanation does not mean that the event has interstellar origins\".Physicist Don Lincoln suggested that it was \"very unlikely that what these pilots are reporting turns out to be an unfriendly superweapon or an alien craft,\" however he would like to see the reports investigated \"under the premise that the best science is done when as many opinions are considered as possible, preferably in the open and subject to peer review.\" According to Lincoln, \"unidentified doesn\'t mean flying saucer or a Russian superweapon. It merely means unidentified.\" Science journalist Dennis Overbye argued a \"stubborn residue\" of unexplained aerial phenomenon remain after review. Overbye highlighted that some of these accounts are obtained from respected observers such as military pilots. However, he cautioned, \"as modern psychology and neuroscience have established, the senses are an unreliable portal to reality, whatever that is.\"According to Steve Cummings of Raytheon Space and Airborne Systems, the video images captured by a Raytheon-made Advanced Targeting Forward Look Infrared sensor (ATFLIR) are not definitive proof that the jet pilots were chasing an actual UFO. Cummings noted, \"To really be sure, we would need the raw data. Visual displays alone are not the best evidence\".According to Joe Nickell writing for the Skeptical Inquirer, there are differing versions of Fravor’s account, including a “truly curious document that tells Fravor’s story in the form of a military-style briefing” designed to create a \"pseudo top-secret appearance\". Nickell identifies the document as \"a third-person account of an interview with Fravor, produced by a fringe-ideas group called To the Stars Academy of Arts and Science\". Regarding the visual sightings reported by Fravor, Nickell questioned how he could see \"what a forty-foot object was doing from forty miles away\" and characterized the \"confusion and incompleteness in the reports\" of the training mission as a \"comedy of errors\". Nickell and astronomer and former Air Force pilot James E. McGaha speculated that reports of churning water could have been caused by a submerging submarine, sightings could have been of a reconnaissance drone, and that \"one video image showing an object suddenly zooming off screen was likely caused by the plane’s banking while the camera was stopped at the end of its sweep\".\n\nJoe Nickell further argues this was Fravor\'s first military assignment with the U.S. Navy’s F-18 Super Hornet, and as a result, the experience \"obviously rattled him.\" The Washington Post identified David Fravor as \"the commanding officer of the VFA-41 Black Aces,\" at the time of the 2004 incident. The Toledo Blade stated Fravor retired from military service in 2006, after a 24 year career, including 18 years as a Navy pilot and deployments in Iraq that began during Desert Storm. Fravor stated the identities of other Naval officers aboard the two fighter jets during his mission on November 14, 2004 had not been released publicly as they were still active in the military at the time of the Blade publication in 2018.Nickell and astronomer James E. McGaha state that the reported encounter \"appears to have been a series of misunderstandings and misperceptions, with no evidence of \"an extraterrestrial encounter\".Stephen Pope, editor of Flying magazine criticized the storiesof the incident in The New York Times as \"borderline-sensationalist\" and says they provoked \"a flurry of breathless reporting by media outlets around the world, most of which seem to have failed to notice that the Times’ original reporting has some major problems with it.\" Pope noted that the purported UFO videos were not released by the Pentagon, but by a former official who is now connected to \"To the Stars Academy of the Arts and Sciences\", a Las Vegas company that is seeking funding for UFO research.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n2015 FighterSweep.com account of the incident\n\"Strike Fighter Commander Details Incredible UFO Event\" on YouTube', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3e/FA-18_Hornet_VFA-41.jpg'),
(91, 'Project Grudge', 'Project Grudge was a short-lived project by the U.S. Air Force to investigate unidentified flying objects (UFOs). Grudge succeeded Project Sign in February, 1949, and was then followed by Project Blue Book. The project formally ended in December 1949, but continued in a minimal capacity until late 1951.\n\n\n== Background ==\nProject Sign had been active from 1947 to 1949. Some of Sign\'s personnel, including director Robert Sneider, favored the extraterrestrial hypothesis as the best explanation for UFO reports. They prepared the Estimate of the Situation arguing their case. This hypothesis was ultimately rejected by high-ranking officers, and Project Sign was dissolved and replaced by Project Grudge.\n\n\n== The Grudge era ==\nIt was announced that Grudge would take over where Sign had left off, still investigating UFO reports. But as Air Force Captain Edward J. Ruppelt wrote, \"In doing this, standard intelligence procedures would be used. This normally means an unbiased evaluation of intelligence data. But it doesn\'t take a great deal of study of the old UFO files to see that standard intelligence procedures were not being followed by Project Grudge. Everything was being evaluated on the premise that UFOs couldn\'t exist. No matter what you see or hear, don\'t believe it.\" (Ruppelt, 59-60, emphasis his)\nRuppelt noted that some of \"ATIC\'s Air Technical Intelligence Center\'s top intelligence specialists who had been so eager to work on Project Sign were no longer working on Project Grudge. Some of them had drastically and hurriedly changed their minds about UFOs when they learned the Pentagon was no longer sympathetic to the UFO cause.\" (Ruppelt, 60)\nAs Dr. Michael D. Swords writes, \"Inside the military, Maj. Aaron J. Boggs in the Pentagon and Col. Harold Watson at AMC Air Material Command were openly giving the impression that the whole flying saucer business was ridiculous. Project Grudge became an exercise of derision and sloppy filing. Boggs was so enthusiastically antisaucer that General Cabell ordered General Moore to create a more proper atmosphere of skeptical respect for the reports and their observers.\" (Swords, 98)\nCritics charged that, from its formation, Project Grudge was operating under a debunking directive: all UFO reports were judged to have prosaic explanations, though little research was conducted, and some of Grudge\'s \"explanations\" were strained or even logically untenable.  In his 1956 book, Edward J. Ruppelt would describe Grudge as the \"Dark Ages\" of USAF UFO investigation. Grudge’s personnel were in fact conducting little or no investigation, while simultaneously relating that all UFO reports were being thoroughly reviewed.  Ruppelt additionally reported that the word \"Grudge\" was chosen deliberately by the anti-saucer elements in the Air Force.\n\n\n=== Public relations campaign ===\nLike Project Sign, Grudge thought that the vast bulk of UFO reports could be explained as misidentified clouds, stars, sun dogs, conventional aircraft or the like. However, unlike Sign which thought some UFOs might have an extraordinary answer, Grudge\'s personnel thought the remaining minority of reports could be explained away as normal phenomena.  Grudge began a public relations campaign to explain their conclusions to the general public.\nThe first salvo in the PR campaign came via Sidney Shallet of the Saturday Evening Post, one of the more popular magazines of the era. Shallet\'s article appeared in two consecutive issues of the Post (April 30 and May 7, 1949) and generally echoed the Grudge line: Most UFO reports could be easily explained as mundane phenomena misidentified by an eyewitness, the subject was blown out of proportion by the mass media. Shallet suggested that hoaxes and crackpots played a prominent role in popularizing UFOs, and the opinions of many high-ranking military personnel were featured.\nThe article also included a few misrepresentations of the facts. Shallet asserted that the Air Force thought the subject was nonsense, and was more or less forced to investigate flying saucers due to public interest—this was manifestly false, as the Air Force took the UFO subject seriously nearly from the beginning. Shallet, of course, did not have access to some secret information, such as the 1947 memorandum by Gen. Nathan Twining that had declared flying saucers a \"real and not visionary\" phenomenon and had kickstarted Project Sign, and did not mention Sign\'s secret Estimate of the Situation that had argued in favor of an extraterrestrial origin for UFOs.\nShallett\'s article was perhaps the first detailed public discussion of UFOs, let alone with the endorsement of such prominent military men. Grudge had hoped the article would reduce public interest in flying saucers, but the effect was just the opposite: Shallet had mentioned in passing that a small minority of UFO reports seemed to defy analysis, and these statements were seized upon by the press and the curious. Ruppelt wrote that rather than squelching interest, Shallet had \"planted the seed of doubt\" in the general public.\n\n\n=== The Grudge report ===\nProject Grudge issued its only formal report in August 1949. Though over 600 pages long, the report\'s conclusions stated:\n\nA. There is no evidence that objects reported upon are the result of an advanced scientific foreign development; and, therefore they constitute no direct threat to the national security. In view of this, it is recommended that the investigation and study of reports of unidentified flying objects be reduced in scope. Headquarters AMC Air Material Command will continue to investigate reports in which realistic technical applications are clearly indicated.NOTE: It is apparent that further study along present lines would only confirm the findings presented herein. It is further recommended that pertinent collection directives be revised to reflect the contemplated change in policy. B. All evidence and analyses indicate that reports of unidentified flying objects are the result of:1. Misinterpretation of various conventional objects.\n2. A mild form of mass-hysteria and war nerves. \n3. Individuals who fabricate such reports to perpetrate a hoax or to seek publicity. \n4. Psychopathological persons.Not long after this report was released, it was reported that Grudge would soon be dissolved. Despite this announcement, Grudge was not quite finished. A few personnel were still assigned to the project, and they aided the authors of a few more debunking mass media articles.\n\n\n=== Tension ===\nIn April 1951 Bob Ginna of Life magazine visited Wright Patterson Air Force Base. Investigating Grudge, he uncovered what Clark describes as \"the project\'s manifest shortcomings\". (Clark, 239)  In response (at least \"for appearances sake\" according to Clark (ibid.) some of the more obviously anti-UFO personnel at Wright Patterson were reassigned. By mid-1951, Grudge consisted only of Lt. Gerry Cummings. According to Ruppelt, Cummings took his job seriously, but found little help or success in his efforts to reverse several years of apathy and dubious research.\nOn September 10, 1951, there was a radar/visual UFO encounter near Fort Monmouth in New Jersey.  Pilots and radar operators reported encounters with a number of fast-moving, highly maneuverable disc-shaped aircraft. High-ranking personnel ordered an investigation, and Cummings and Lt. Colonel N.R. Rosegarten spent most of 13 September interviewing witnesses and gathering documentation at Ft. Monmouth.\nThe duo were then ordered to relate the results of their investigation directly to Major General Charles P. Cabell, then the head of Air Force intelligence at The Pentagon. Cummings and Rosegarten arrived at a meeting already in progress, and found the atmosphere thick with tension. Cabell in particular was distressed by what he saw as the sloppy debunking and lackadaisical attitude Project Grudge brought to bear on a subject he thought deserved serious scrutiny. Cummings and Rosegarten related their conclusions of the Fort Monmouth incident: they agreed with Monmouth personnel who judged the fast moving objects sighted there as being \"intelligently controlled.\" (Clark, 240)\nWhen given permission to speak freely to Cabell and the others, Cummings (as Ruppelt wrote) \"cut loose. He told how every UFO report [submitted to Grudge] was taken as a huge joke\" and Grudge had become all but moribund. (Clark, 240)\nWhen General Cabell learned that Grudge had essentially ignored UFO reports, he  became furious. The Fort Monmouth case had highlighted what critics saw as Air Material Command\'s sloppy debunking, and at a meeting, a frustrated Cabell was reported to have said, \"I want an open mind; in fact, I order an open mind! Anyone who doesn\'t keep an open mind can get out now! ... Why do I have to stir up the action? Anyone can see that we do not have a satisfactory answer to the saucer question.\" (Swords, p. 103) At another meeting—this one of high-ranking military Colonels—Cabell said, \"I\'ve been lied to, and lied to, and lied to. I want it to stop. I want the answer to the saucers and I want a good answer.\" (Swords, p. 103) Cabell also characterized the 1949 Grudge report as \"tripe\".\nLt. Col. N.R. Rosegarten asked Ruppelt to take over as the new project’s leader in late 1951, partly because Ruppelt \"had a reputation as a good organizer.\" (Jacobs, 65) While Cabell wanted Grudge reactivated, he did not want the general public to know that he and some others in the military took UFOs seriously, and ordered the project to keep a low profile. This, he hoped, would protect the military\'s reputation on both fronts: if the saucer phenomenon was groundless, they could not be accused of sensationalism, but if the phenomenon proved to have some basis in fact, the military could produce serious studies of the subject. Cabell especially did not want the military to be perceived as belittling civilians who had reported UFOs.\nGrudge became Project Blue Book. Its first era—directed by Ruppelt—is generally seen as its most open-minded and productive era.\n\n\n== Sources ==\nJerome Clark; The UFO Book: Encyclopedia of the Extraterrestrial; Visible Ink, 1998; ISBN 1-57859-029-9\nDavid Michael Jacobs; The UFO Controversy In America; Indiana University Press, 1975; ISBN 0-253-19006-1\nEdward J.

(92, 'Mantell UFO incident', 'On January 7, 1948, 25-year-old Captain Thomas F. Mantell, a Kentucky Air National Guard pilot, died in the crash of his P-51 Mustang fighter, after being sent in pursuit of an unidentified flying object (UFO). The event  was among the most publicized early UFO incidents.\nLater investigation by the United States Air Force\'s Project Blue Book indicated that Mantell may have died chasing a Skyhook balloon, which in 1948 was a top-secret project that Mantell would not have known about. Mantell pursued the object in a steep climb, and disregarded suggestions to level his altitude. At high altitude he blacked out from a lack of oxygen. His relative inexperience with the P-51 may have been a contributing factor.\nHistorian David M. Jacobs argues the Mantell case marked a sharp shift in both public and governmental perceptions of UFOs. Previously, the news media often treated UFO reports with a whimsical or glib attitude reserved for “silly season news”. Following Mantell\'s death, however, Jacobs notes \"the fact that a person had died in an encounter with an alleged flying saucer dramatically increased public concern about the phenomenon. Now a dramatic new prospect entered thought about UFOs: they might be not only extraterrestrial but potentially hostile as well.\"\n\n\n== Incident ==\n\nMantell was an experienced pilot; his flight history consisted of 2,167 hours in the air, and he had been honored for his part in the Battle of Normandy during World War II.On 7 January 1948, Godman Army Airfield at Fort Knox, Kentucky, received a report from the Kentucky Highway Patrol of an unusual aerial object near Madisonville, Kentucky. Reports of a westbound circular object, 250–300 feet (80–90 m) in diameter, were received from Owensboro and Irvington.At about 1:45 p.m., Sergeant Quinton Blackwell saw an object from his position in the control tower at Fort Knox. Two other witnesses in the tower also reported a white object in the distance. Colonel Guy Hix, the base commander, reported an object he described as \"very white,\" and \"about one fourth the size of the full moon ... Through binoculars it appeared to have a red border at the bottom ... It remained stationary, seemingly, for one and a half hours.\"  Observers at Clinton County Army Air Field in Ohio described the object \"as having the appearance of a flaming red cone trailing a gaseous green mist\" and observed the object for around 35 minutes.  Another observer at Lockbourne Army Air Field in Ohio noted, \"Just before leaving it came to very near the ground, staying down for about ten seconds, then climbed at a very fast rate back to its original altitude, 10,000 feet, leveling off and disappearing into the overcast heading 120 degrees. Its speed was greater than 500 mph (800 km/h) in level flight.\"Four F-51D Mustangs of C Flight, 165th Fighter Squadron Kentucky Air National Guard—one piloted by Mantell—were already in the air and told to approach the object. Blackwell was in radio communication with the pilots throughout the event.\nOne pilot\'s Mustang was low on fuel, and he quickly returned to base. Air Force Captain Edward J. Ruppelt (the first head of Project Blue Book) notes that there was some disagreement amongst the air traffic controllers as to Mantell\'s words as he communicated with the tower: some sources reported that Mantell had described an object \"[which] looks metallic and of tremendous size,\" but according to Ruppelt, others disputed whether or not Mantell actually said this.The other two pilots accompanied Mantell in steep pursuit of the object. They later reported they saw an object, but described it as so small and indistinct that they could not identify it. Mantell ignored suggestions that the pilots should level their altitude and try to more clearly see the object.Only one of Mantell\'s wingmen, Lt. Albert Clements, had an oxygen mask, and his oxygen was in low supply. Clements and the third pilot, Lt. Hammond, called off their pursuit at 22,500 feet (6,900 m). Mantell continued to climb, however. According to the Air Force, once Mantell passed 25,000 feet (7,600 m) he blacked out from the lack of oxygen (hypoxia), and his plane began spiraling back towards the ground. A witness later reported Mantell\'s Mustang in a circling descent. His plane crashed on a farm south of Franklin, Kentucky, on the Kentucky–Tennessee state line.Firemen later pulled Mantell\'s body from the Mustang\'s wreckage. His seat belt was shredded, and his wristwatch had stopped at 3:18 p.m., the time of his crash. Meanwhile, by 3:50 p.m. the UFO was no longer visible to observers at Godman Army Airfield. The Mantell incident was reported by newspapers around the nation, and received significant news media attention. A number of sensational rumors were also circulated about Mantell\'s crash. According to UFO historian Curtis Peebles, among the rumors were claims that \"the flying saucer was a Soviet missile; it was [an alien] spacecraft that shot down [Mantell\'s fighter] when it got too close; Captain Mantell\'s body was found riddled with bullets; the body was missing; the plane had completely disintegrated in the air; [and] the wreckage was radioactive.\" However, no evidence has ever surfaced to substantiate any of these claims, and Air Force investigation specifically refuted some claims, such as the supposedly radioactive wreckage. Captain Ruppelt wrote that \"I had always heard a lot of wild speculation about the condition of Mantell\'s crashed F-51, so I wired for a copy of the accident report. [It] said that...Mantell\'s body had not burned, not disintegrated, and was not full of holes; the wreck was not radioactive, nor was it magnetized.\" Mantell was the first member of the Kentucky Air National Guard to die in flight. According to John Trowbridge, historian of the Kentucky National Guard, \"There is a real X-Files twist to this, too. Mantell lived almost his entire life in Louisville, but he was born in a hospital in Franklin, only a few miles from where he was killed.\"In 1956, Ruppelt wrote that the Mantell crash was one of three \"classic\" UFO cases in 1948 that would help to define the UFO phenomenon in the public mind, and would help convince some Air Force intelligence specialists that UFOs were a \"real\", physical phenomenon.  The other two \"classic\" sightings in 1948 were the Chiles-Whitted UFO encounter and the Gorman dogfight.\n\n\n== Venus explanation and rejection ==\nThe Mantell crash was investigated by Project Sign, the first Air Force research group assigned to investigate UFO reports. One writer noted that \"The people on Project Sign worked fast on the Mantell Incident. Contemplating a flood of queries from the press as soon as they heard about the crash, they realized that they had to get a quick answer. Venus had been the target of a chase by an Air Force F-51 several weeks before and there were similarities between this sighting and the Mantell Incident. So...the word \'Venus\' went out. Mantell had unfortunately been killed trying to reach the planet Venus.\" An Air Force major who was interviewed by several reporters following Mantell\'s crash \"flatly stated that it was Venus.\"In 1952 USAF Captain Edward Ruppelt, the supervisor of Project Blue Book, Project Sign\'s successor, was ordered to reinvestigate the Mantell Incident. Ruppelt spoke with Dr. J. Allen Hynek, an astronomer at Ohio State University and scientific consultant to Project Sign and Project Blue Book. Hynek had supplied Project Sign with the Venus explanation in 1948, mainly because Venus had been in the same place in the sky that Mantell\'s UFO was observed. However, by 1952 Dr. Hynek had concluded that the Venus explanation was incorrect, because \"Venus wasn\'t bright enough to be seen\" by Mantell and the other witnesses, and because a considerable haze was present that would have further obscured the planet in the sky. Ruppelt also noted Dr. Hynek\'s statement that Venus, even if visible, would have been a \"pinpoint of light\", but that eyewitness \"descriptions plainly indicated a large object. None of the descriptions could even vaguely be called a pinpoint of light.\"\n\n\n== Skyhook balloon explanation ==\nHaving rejected the Venus explanation, Captain Ruppelt began to research other explanations for the incident. He was particularly interested in a suggestion by Dr. Hynek that Mantell could have misidentified a United States Navy Skyhook  weather balloon. In Madisonville, Kentucky \"the object was seen through a telescope [and] identified as a balloon by one observer.\" Additionally, between 4:30 and 4:45 PM an astronomer at Vanderbilt University \"watched an object in the sky...viewed through binoculars, he said it was a pear-shaped balloon with cables and a basket attached.\"However, others disputed this idea, noting that no particular Skyhook balloon could be conclusively identified as being in the area in question during Mantell\'s pursuit. Despite this objection, Ruppelt thought the Skyhook explanation was plausible: the balloons were a secret Navy project at the time of Mantell\'s crash, were made of reflective aluminum, and were about 100 feet (30 m) in diameter, consistent with the description of the UFO as large, metallic, and cone-shaped. Since the Skyhook balloons were secret at the time, neither Mantell nor the other observers in the air control tower would have been able to identify the UFO as a Skyhook. But this was never proved, as Ruppelt wrote:\n\"Somewhere in the archives of the Air Force or the Navy there are records that will show whether or not a balloon was launched from Clinton County AFB, Ohio, on January 7, 1948. I never could find these records. People who were working with the early skyhook projects \"remember\" operating out of Clinton County AFB in 1947 but refuse to be pinned down to a January 7 flight. Maybe, they said. The Mantell Incident is the same old UFO jigsaw puzzle.\"Project Skyhook was legally linked with General Mills, the cereal company, Jean Piccard, the French Balloonist, and Otto C. Winzen of Winzen Research.\n\n\n== Inexperience with the F-51 ==\nResearchers have also noted that while Mantell was an experienced pilot, he was rather new to the F-51, and that this relative inexperience could have been a factor in the crash. This does not, of course, account for the identity of the UFO.\n\n\n== Thomas Mantell biography ==\nCaptain Thomas Francis Mantell Jr. (30 June 1922 – 7 January 1948) was a United States Air Force officer and a World War II veteran. Mantell was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for courageous action during the Operation Market Garden, and an Air Medal with three Oak leaf clusters for aerial achievement.\n\n\n=== Career ===\nMantell graduated from Male High School in Louisville. On 16 June 1942, Mantell joined the United States Army Air Corps, finishing Flight School on 30 June 1943. During World War II, he was C-47 Skytrain pilot assigned to the 96th Troop Carrier Squadron, 440th Troop Carrier Group, which air dropped the 101st Airborne Division into Normandy, France on 6 June 1944 and participated in Operation Market Garden.  \nMantell, then a lieutenant, was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for heroism while flying over Holland on 18 September 1944 during Operation Market Garden.  He was the pilot of a cargo plane, named Vulture\'s  Delight, towing a glider, when it came under heavy anti-aircraft fire. All but one of the rudder and elevator controls were disabled, and the aircraft\'s tail was afire.  Mantell\'s crew chief fought the fire with live ammunition detonating. Rather than release the glider, Lt. Mantell decided to continue with his misson. The glider was released at the correct location, and Mantell returned to base.  Upon inspection, his aircraft was so damaged that it appeared to be unable to fly.   Mantell was nicknamed \"Shiny\" by his comrades. This was because of his \"constant well-scrubbed look.\"   Mantell was also described as \"able to think fast and act quickly.\" After the war, Mantell returned to Louisville, joining the newly formed Kentucky Air National Guard on 16 February 1947.  He became a F-51D Mustang pilot in the 165th Fighter Squadron.\nFollowing his death in January 1948, Mantell\'s remains were sent to Louisville for burial in the Zachary Taylor National Cemetery.\n\nOn 29 September 2001, the Simpson County Historical Society unveiled a historical marker in honor of Thomas Mantell in his hometown of Franklin. The marker is located at the exit off Interstate 65.\n\n\n=== Awards ===\nPilot Badge\nDistinguished Flying Cross\nAir Medal with three oak leaf clusters\nDistinguished Unit Citation\nAmerican Campaign Medal\nEuropean–African–Middle Eastern Campaign Medal with two campaign stars\nWorld War II Victory Medal\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nThe Mantell incident is one of the earliest UFO incidents to attract widespread public attention.  It is considered one of the \"classic\" UFO incidents from the late 1940s.\nThe Mantell incident was featured in the 1956 quasi-documentary Unidentified Flying Objects: The True Story of Flying Saucers.  The film helped spur public interest in UFOs and speculation that UFOs were of extraterrestrial origin.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of reported UFO sightings\nProject Mogul\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Additional references ===\n\n\n== External links ==\nUFO Casebook: The Death of Thomas Mantell (includes official documents)\n1948, The Death of Thomas Mantell, UFO Casebook Files\n1948-Death of Thomas Mantell:By Billy Booth, About.com', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/Capt._Mantell_Marker.jpg');

(93, 'Aquatic ape hypothesis', 'The aquatic ape hypothesis (AAH), also referred to as aquatic ape theory (AAT) and more recently the waterside model, is the idea that the ancestors of modern humans were more aquatic and as such were habitual waders, swimmers and divers. The hypothesis in its present form was proposed by the marine biologist Alister Hardy in 1960, who argued that a branch of apes was forced by competition over terrestrial habitats to hunt for food such as shellfish on the sea shore and sea bed leading to adaptations that explained significant characteristics such as man\'s functional hairlessness and bipedalism. This proposal was built upon by Elaine Morgan, who added feminist criticism in opposition to the male image of the \"mighty hunter\" being presented in popular anthropological works by Raymond Dart and others. While her 1972 book The Descent of Woman was very popular with the public, it attracted little attention from scientists and those who did comment complained that there was no way of testing hypotheses about soft body parts and human habits in the distant past.\nMorgan removed the feminist content in several later books and her ideas were discussed at a 1987 conference devoted to the idea. Her 1990 book Scars of Evolution received some favorable reviews but the thesis was subject to scathing criticism from the anthropologist John Langdon in 1997, who characterized it as an \"umbrella hypothesis\" and argued that the hypothesis is not more parsimonious than simply rejecting the hypothesis.The hypothesis remains highly controversial and is generally more popular with the lay public than with scientists. Though much of the mainstream academic community ignored or derided the initial proposal, academics in the last 15 years have conducted research at least in part inspired by AAH. Scientists supportive of AAH have published research that indicates that at some point in the last five million years humans became dependent on essential fatty acids and iodine, which are found in abundance in sea resources. Efficient function of the human brain requires these nutrients.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe German pathologist Max Westenhöfer (1871–1957) discussed in 1942 various human characteristics (hairlessness, subcutaneous fat, the regression of the olfactory organ, webbed fingers, direction of the body hair etc.) that could have derived from an aquatic past, quoting several other authors who had made similar speculations. As he did not believe human beings were apes, he believed this might have been during the Cretaceous, contrary to what is possible given the geologic and evolutionary biology evidence available at the time. He stated: \"The postulation of an aquatic mode of life during an early stage of human evolution is a tenable hypothesis, for which further inquiry may produce additional supporting evidence.\" He later abandoned the concept.Independently of Westenhöfer\'s writings, the marine biologist Alister Hardy had since 1930 also hypothesized that humans may have had ancestors more aquatic than previously imagined, although his work, unlike Westenhöfer\'s, was rooted in the Darwinian consensus. On the advice of his colleagues, Hardy delayed presenting the hypothesis for approximately thirty years. After he had become a respected academic and knighted for contributions to marine biology, Hardy finally voiced his thoughts in a speech to the British Sub-Aqua Club in Brighton on 5 March 1960. Several national newspapers reported sensational presentations of Hardy\'s ideas, which he countered by explaining them more fully in an article in New Scientist on 17 March 1960: \"My thesis is that a branch of this primitive ape-stock was forced by competition from life in the trees to feed on the sea-shores and to hunt for food, shellfish, sea-urchins etc., in the shallow waters off the coast.\"The idea was generally ignored by the scientific community after the article was published. Some interest was received, notably from the geographer Carl Sauer whose views on the role of the seashore in human evolution \"stimulated tremendous progress in the study of coastal and aquatic adaptations\" inside marine archaeology. In 1967, the hypothesis was mentioned in The Naked Ape, a popular book by the zoologist Desmond Morris, who reduced Hardy\'s phrase \"more aquatic ape-like ancestors\" to the bare \"aquatic ape\", commenting that \"despite its most appealing indirect evidence, the aquatic theory lacks solid support\".While traditional descriptions of \'savage\' existence identified three common sources of sustenance: gathering of fruit and nuts, fishing and hunting, in the 1950s, the anthropologist Raymond Dart focused on hunting and gathering as the likely organizing concept of human society in prehistory, and hunting was the focus of the screenwriter Robert Ardrey\'s 1961 best-seller African Genesis. Another screenwriter, Elaine Morgan, responded to this focus in her 1972 Descent of Woman, which parodied the conventional picture of \"the Tarzanlike figure of the prehominid who came down from the trees, saw a grassland teeming with game, picked up a weapon and became a Mighty Hunter,\" and pictured a more peaceful scene of humans by the seashore. She took her lead from a section in Morris\'s 1967 book which referred to the possibility of an Aquatic Ape period in evolution, his name for the speculation by the biologist Alister Hardy in 1960. When it aroused no reaction in the academic community, she dropped the feminist criticism and wrote a series of books–The Aquatic Ape (1982), The Scars of Evolution (1990), The Descent of the Child (1994) and The Aquatic Ape Hypothesis (1997)–which explored the issues in more detail.\n\n\n== The Hardy/Morgan hypothesis ==\nHardy\'s hypothesis as outlined in the New Scientist was:\n\nMy thesis is that a branch of this primitive ape-stock was forced by competition from life in the trees to feed on the sea-shores and to hunt for food, shell fish, sea-urchins etc., in the shallow waters off the coast. I suppose that they were forced into the water just as we have seen happen in so many other groups of terrestrial animals. I am imagining this happening in the warmer parts of the world, in the tropical seas where Man could stand being in the water for relatively long periods, that is, several hours at a stretch.Hardy argued a number of features of modern humans are characteristic of aquatic adaptations. He pointed to human\'s lack of body hair as being analogous to the same lack seen in certain other marine mammals, such as the whale and the hippopotamus, and noted the layer of subcutaneous fat humans have that Hardy believed other apes lacked, although it has been shown that captive apes with ample access to food have levels of subcutaneous fat similar to humans. Additional features cited by Hardy include the location of the trachea in the throat rather than the nasal cavity, the human propensity for front-facing copulation, tears and eccrine sweating, though these claimed pieces of evidence have alternative evolutionary adaptationist explanations that do not invoke an aquatic context. Hardy additionally posited that bipedalism evolved first as an aid to wading before becoming the usual means of human locomotion, and tool use evolved out of the use of rocks to crack open shellfish. These last arguments were cited by later proponents of AAH as an inspiration for their research programs.\nMorgan summed up her take on the hypothesis in 2011:\n\nWaterside hypotheses of human evolution assert that selection from wading, swimming and diving and procurement of food from aquatic habitats have significantly affected the evolution of the lineage leading to Homo sapiens as distinct from that leading to Pan.\n\n\n== Reactions ==\n\nAcademics who have commented on the aquatic ape hypothesis include categorical opponents (generally members of the community of academic anthropology) who reject almost all of the claims related to the hypothesis. Other academics have argued that the rejection of Hardy and Morgan is partially unfair given that other explanations which suffer from similar problems are not so strongly opposed. A conference devoted to the subject was held at Valkenburg, Netherlands in 1987. Its 22 participants included academic proponents and opponents of the theory and several neutral observers headed by the anthropologist Vernon Reynolds of Oxford University. His summary at the end was:Overall, it will be clear that I do not think it would be correct to designate our early hominid ancestors as \'aquatic\'. But at the same time there does seem to be evidence that not only did they take to water from time to time but that the water (and by this I mean inland lakes and rivers) was a habitat that provided enough extra food to count as an agency for selection.\n\n\n=== Critiques ===\nThe AAH has received little attention from mainstream anthropologists and paleoanthropologists. It is not accepted as empirically supported by the scholarly community, and has been met with significant skepticism.In a 1997 critique, anthropologist John Langdon considered the AAH under the heading of an \"umbrella hypothesis\" and argued that the difficulty of ever disproving such a thing meant that although the idea has the appearance of being a parsimonious explanation, it actually was no more powerful an explanation than the null hypothesis that human evolution is not particularly guided by interaction with bodies of water. Langdon argued that however popular the idea was with the public, the \"umbrella\" nature of the idea means that it cannot serve as a proper scientific hypothesis. Langdon also objected to Morgan\'s blanket opposition to the \"savannah hypothesis\" which he took to be the \"collective discipline of paleoanthropology\". He observed that some anthropologists had regarded the idea as not worth the trouble of a rebuttal. In addition, the evidence cited by AAH proponents mostly concerned developments in soft tissue anatomy and physiology, whilst paleoanthropologists rarely speculated on evolutionary development of anatomy beyond the musculoskeletal system and brain size as revealed in fossils. After a brief description of the issues under 26 different headings, he produced a summary critique of these with mainly negative judgments. His main conclusion was that the AAH was unlikely ever to be disproved on the basis of comparative anatomy, and that the one body of data that could potentially disprove it was the fossil record.Anthropologist John D. Hawks wrote that it is fair to categorize the AAH as pseudoscience because of the social factors that inform it, particularly the personality-led nature of the hypothesis and the unscientific approach of its adherents. Physical anthropologist Eugenie Scott has described the aquatic ape hypothesis as an instance of \"crank anthropology\" akin to other pseudoscientific ideas in anthropology such as alien-human interbreeding and Bigfoot.In The Accidental Species: Misunderstandings of Human Evolution (2013), the Nature editor Henry Gee remarked on how a seafood diet can aid in the development of the human brain. He nevertheless criticized the AAH because \"it\'s always a problem identifying features [such as body fat and hairlessness] that humans have now and inferring that they must have had some adaptive value in the past.\" Also \"it\'s notoriously hard to infer habits [such as swimming] from anatomical structures\".Popular support for the AAH has become an embarrassment to some anthropologists who want to explore the effects of water on human evolution without engaging with the AAH, which they consider \"emphasizes adaptations to deep water (or at least underwater) conditions\". Foley and Lahr suggest that \"to flirt with anything watery in paleoanthropology can be misinterpreted\", but argue \"there is little doubt that throughout our evolution we have made extensive use of terrestrial habitats adjacent to fresh water, since we are, like many other terrestrial mammals, a heavily water-dependent species.\" But they allege that \"under pressure from the mainstream, AAH supporters tended to flee from the core arguments of Hardy and Morgan towards a more generalized emphasis on fishy things.\"In \"The Waterside Ape\", a pair of 2016 BBC Radio documentaries, David Attenborough, discussed a \"move towards mainstream acceptance” for the AAH in the light of new research findings. Scientists interviewed included Kathlyn Stewart and Michael Crawford who had published papers in a special issue of the Journal of Human Evolution on \"The Role of Freshwater and Marine Resources in the Evolution of the Human Diet, Brain and Behavior\". Responding to the documentaries in a newspaper article, paleoanthropologist Alice Roberts dismissed the AAH as a distraction \"from the emerging story of human evolution that is more interesting and complex\" and that it had become \"a theory of everything\" that is simultaneously \"too extravagant and too simple\".Philosopher Daniel Dennett, in his discussion of evolutionary philosophy, commented\n\"During the last few years, when I have found myself in the company of distinguished biologists, evolutionary theorists, paleoanthropologists and other experts, I have often asked them to tell me, please, exactly why Elaine Morgan must be wrong about the aquatic theory. I haven’t yet had a reply worth mentioning, aside from those who admit, with a twinkle in their eyes, that they have also wondered the same thing.\" He challenged both Elaine Morgan and the scientific establishment in that \"Both sides are indulging in adapt[at]ionist Just So stories\". Along the same lines, historian Erika Lorraine Milam noted that independent of Morgan\'s work, certain standard explanations of human development in paleoanthropology have been roundly criticized for lacking evidence while being based on sexist assumptions. Anatomy lecturer Bruce Charlton gave Morgan\'s book Scars of Evolution an enthusiastic review in the British Medical Journal in 1991, calling it \"exceptionally well written\" and \"a good piece of science\".In 1995, paleoanthropologist Phillip Tobias declared that the savannah hypothesis was dead, because the open conditions did not exist when humanity\'s precursors stood upright and that therefore the conclusions of the Valkenberg conference were no longer valid. Tobias praised Morgan\'s book Scars of Evolution as a \"remarkable book\" though he said that he did not agree with all of it. Tobias and his student further criticised the orthodox hypothesis by arguing that the coming out of the forest of man\'s precursors had been an unexamined assumption of evolution since the days of Lamarck, and followed by Darwin, Wallace and Haeckel, well before Raymond Dart used it.\n\n\n=== Reactions of Hardy and Morgan ===\nAlister Hardy was astonished and mortified in 1960 when the national Sunday papers carried banner headlines \"Oxford professor says man a sea ape\", causing problems with his Oxford colleagues. As he later said to his ex-pupil Desmond Morris, \"Of course I then had to write an article to refute this saying no this is just a guess, a rough hypothesis, this isn\'t a proven fact. And of course we\'re not related to dolphins.\"Elaine Morgan\'s 1972 book Descent of Woman became an international best-seller, a Book of the Month selection in the United States and was translated into ten languages. Part of this was related to the growing women\'s liberation movement as Morgan\'s work was inspired by a feminist critique of then-standard anthropological ideas. She assumed that the total lack of response to her book from the academic community was due to the fact that she was an outsider. \"The response I had not foreseen was total silence. But in respect of the aquatic theme that is what I got from them - and with few exceptions still get. That kind of silence is a virtually unbeatable strategy\". Morgan removed the feminist critique and rewrote the scientific text, publishing it as The Aquatic Ape ten years later, but it did not garner greater reaction from scientists.\n\n\n== Related academic and independent research ==\nAlthough the general reaction to Hardy and Morgan\'s proposals was silence by the relevant academic community, there have been over the last decades some academics who were inspired by AAH proposals, even to the point of pursuing particular lines of research on its basis. Some of the academics and professional scientists who have supported the AAH include Michael Crawford, Professor and Director of the Institute of Brain Chemistry and Human Nutrition at Imperial College London, his former postdoctoral researcher, Stephen Cunnane, now professor of medicine at Université de Sherbrooke, Erika Schagatay, professor of Environmental Physiology at Mid Sweden University, Kathlyn M. Stewart, Section Head of Palaeobiology at the Canadian Museum of Nature, and Tom Brenna, Professor of Paediatrics and Chemistry at University of Texas.\n\n\n=== Wading and bipedalism ===\nAfter reviewing 30 different explanations of bipedalism, evolutionary biologist Carsten Niemitz proposed a \"shore dweller\" hypothesis of wading, though distancing himself from the AAH. He records 10 monkey and ape species, including chimpanzees and gorillas, who have been observed wading on two feet. Niemitz\'s hypothesis places the wading bipedalism of hominids as occurring in the late Miocene. Other researchers, including AAH proponent Algis Kuliukas, performed experiments to measure the comparative energy used when lacking orthograde posture with using fully upright posture. Although it is harder to walk upright with bent knees on land, this difference gradually diminishes as the depth of water increases and is still practical in thigh-high water.In a critique of the AAH, Henry Gee questioned any link between bipedalism and diet. Gee writes that early humans have been bipedal for 5 million years, but our ancestor\'s \"fondness for seafood\" emerged a mere 200,000 years ago.\n\n\n=== Food sources, nutrients, and brain size ===\n\nIn their 1989 book The Driving Force: Food, Evolution and The Future, Michael Crawford together with co-author David Marsh wrote about the connections they saw between nutrition and human evolution, and in particular claimed that Omega-3 fatty acids were vital for the development of the brain. \"A branch of the line of primitive ancestral apes was forced by competition to leave the trees and feed on the seashore. Searching for oysters, mussels, crabs, crayfish and so on they would have spent much of their time in the water and an upright position would have come naturally.\" Crawford and Marsh argued that the norm of brain size seen in small and aquatic mammals is similar to humans and they further opine that other primates and carnivores had lost relative brain capacity (though the relationship between brain size and intelligence is not isomorphic). Reviewing their book for the New Scientist, biologists Caroline Pond and Dick Colby were highly critical, saying that the work provided \"no significant new information that would be of interest to biologists\" and that its style was \"speculative, theoretical and in many places so imprecise as to be misleading.\"According to Crawford, \"the evolution of a large brain on the savannahs of Africa was impossible. The only way it could have happened was with the resources of the marine food-web which initiated the growth and development of the brain in the first place\". A group of evolutionary nutritionists and paleontologists led by Cunnane, Stewart, and Crawford published works arguing a correlation between aquatic diet and human brain evolution in their \"shore-based diet scenario\", acknowledging the Hardy/Morgan\'s thesis as a foundation work of their model. They describe problems in landlocked communities as being supportive of AAH, with reports of cretinism in the Alps since the 18th century and widespread goitres in parts of Africa, which is only prevented by the addition of iodine to diets. According to Cunnane, \"Without the availability of iodized table salt, non-coastal (inland) habitats do not provide foods rich enough to meet human iodine requirements.\" Evidence supports aquatic food consumption in Homo as early as the Pliocene but its linkage to brain evolution remains controversial.What has been lacking has been the paleontological evidence that early humans consumed fish in significant amounts earlier than tens to hundreds of thousands of years ago. Part of the problem has been the avoidance of taphonomic bias by researchers: most hominin fossils occur in marginal lacustrine environments and the presence of fish remains is therefore no proof of fish consumption. Fish bones often decompose so that special tests are required to detect them. The archaeological record of human fishing and coastal settlement is fundamentally flawed due to postglacial sea level rise.\n\n\n=== Diving behavior and performance ===\nAside from working as a professor, Schagatay is also an experienced scuba and freediver whose research centers around human diving abilities. She suggests that such abilities are consistent with selective pressure for underwater foraging during human evolution, and discussed other anatomical traits speculated as diving adaptations by Hardy/Morgan. John Langdon suggested that such traits could be enabled by a human developmental plasticity.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nAttenborough, David (2016).

(94, 'Ed White (astronaut)', 'Edward Higgins White II (November 14, 1930 – January 27, 1967), (Lt Col, USAF), was an American aeronautical engineer, U.S. Air Force officer, test pilot, and NASA astronaut. On June 3, 1965, he became the first American to walk in space. White died along with astronauts Virgil \"Gus\" Grissom and Roger B. Chaffee during prelaunch testing for the first manned Apollo mission at Cape Canaveral. He was awarded the NASA Distinguished Service Medal for his flight in Gemini 4 and was then awarded the Congressional Space Medal of Honor posthumously.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Early years, education and military service ===\nWhite was born on November 14, 1930, in San Antonio, Texas, to parents Edward Higgins White Sr. (1901–1978), who became a Major General in the U.S. Air Force, and Mary Rosina White (née Haller; 1900–1983). He attended school in his hometown and became a member of the Boy Scouts of America, where he earned the rank of Second Class Scout. After graduation from high school in 1948, he was accepted to the United States Military Academy at West Point, where in 1952 he earned his Bachelor of Science degree and was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant in the Air Force. Then, he attended flight school, a course that takes just over a year. Following graduation from flight school in 1953, White was assigned to the 22nd Fighter Day Squadron at Bitburg Air Base, West Germany. He spent three and a half years in West Germany flying in F-86 Sabre and F-100 Super Sabre squadrons in the defense of NATO.After graduating from West Point, White competed for a spot on the U.S. Olympic team in the 400 meter hurdles race. He missed making the team by only 1/10 second. His hobbies included squash, handball, swimming, golf, and photography.In 1958, White enrolled in the University of Michigan under Air Force sponsorship to study Aeronautical Engineering, where he received his Master of Science degree in 1959. Following graduation, White was selected to attend the U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School at Edwards Air Force Base, California. He earned his credentials as a test pilot in 1959 and was assigned to the Aeronautical Systems Division at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio. During his career, White would log more than 3,000 flight hours with the Air Force, including about 2,200 hours in jets, and would ultimately attain the rank of Lieutenant Colonel.In 1953, White married Patricia Finegan, whom he met while at West Point. The Whites would have two children, Edward White III (born September 16, 1953) and Bonnie Lynn White (born May 15, 1956). White was a devout Methodist.\n\n\n=== NASA career ===\n\n\n==== Project Gemini ====\n\nWhite was one of nine men chosen as part of the second group of astronauts in 1962.  Within an already elite group, White was considered to be a high-flier by the management of NASA. He was chosen as Pilot of Gemini 4, with Command Pilot James McDivitt. White became the first American to make a walk in space, on June 3, 1965.  He found the experience so exhilarating that he was reluctant to terminate the EVA at the allotted time, and had to be ordered back into the spacecraft. While he was outside, a spare thermal glove floated away through the open hatch of the spacecraft, becoming an early piece of space debris in low Earth orbit, until it burned up upon re-entry into the Earth\'s atmosphere. There was a mechanical problem with the hatch mechanism, which made it difficult to open and to relatch, which added to the time constraint of the spacewalk, and could have threatened the lives of both men if McDivitt had been unable to get the hatch latched, as they could not re-enter the atmosphere with an unsealed hatch.\n\nI\'m coming back in... and it\'s the saddest moment of my life.\n\nWhite\'s next assignment after Gemini 4 was as the backup for Gemini 7 Command Pilot Frank Borman. He was also named the astronaut specialist for the flight control systems of the Apollo Command/Service Module. By the usual procedure of crew rotation in the Gemini program, White would have been in line for a second flight as the command pilot of Gemini 10 in July 1966, which would have made him the first of his group to fly twice.\n\n\n==== Apollo program ====\n\nIn March 1966 he was selected as senior pilot (second seat) for the first manned Apollo flight, designated AS-204, along with Command Pilot Virgil \"Gus\" Grissom, who had flown in space on the Mercury 4 Liberty Bell 7 mission and as commander of the Gemini 3 Molly Brown mission, and Pilot Roger Chaffee, who had yet to fly into space. The mission, which the men named Apollo 1 in June, was originally planned for late 1966 (perhaps concurrent with the last Gemini mission), but delays in the spacecraft development pushed the launch into 1967.\n\n\n=== Death ===\n\nThe launch of Apollo 1 was planned for February 21, 1967. The crew entered the spacecraft on January 27, mounted atop its Saturn IB booster on Launch Pad 34 at Cape Kennedy, for a \"plugs-out\" test of the spacecraft, which included a rehearsal of the launch countdown procedure. Midway through the test, a fire broke out in the pure oxygen-filled cabin, killing all three men.\nWhite\'s job was to open the hatch cover in an emergency, which he apparently tried to do; his body was found in his center seat, with his arms reaching over his head toward the hatch. Removing the cover to open the hatch was impossible, because the plug door design required venting normally slightly greater-than-atmospheric pressure and pulling the cover into the cabin. Grissom was unable to reach the cabin vent control to his left, where the fire\'s source was located. The intense heat raised the cabin pressure even more, to the point where the cabin walls ruptured. The astronauts were killed by asphyxiation and smoke inhalation.\nThe fire\'s ignition source was determined to be a spark that jumped from a wire on the far left of the spacecraft, under Grissom\'s seat, but their deaths were attributed to a wide range of lethal hazards in the early Apollo Command Module design and workmanship and conditions of the test, including the highly pressurized 100% oxygen pre-launch atmosphere, many wiring and plumbing flaws, flammable materials used in the cockpit and the astronauts\' flight suits, and a hatch which could not be quickly opened in an emergency. After the incident, these problems were fixed, and the Apollo program carried on successfully to reach its objective of landing men on the Moon.\nWhite was buried with full military honors at West Point Cemetery while Grissom and Chaffee are both buried in Arlington National Cemetery.In 1997, White was posthumously awarded the Congressional Space Medal of Honor. White was inducted into the U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame in 1993 and the National Aviation Hall of Fame on July 18, 2009.White\'s wife Patricia remarried and continued to reside in Houston. On September 7, 1983, she died by suicide after surgery earlier in the year to remove a tumor.\n\n\n== Organizations ==\nHe was a member of the Society of Experimental Test Pilots; associate member of Institute of Aerospace Sciences; Tau Delta Phi (Engineering Honorary); and Sigma Delta Psi (Athletic Honorary).\n\n\n== Awards and honors ==\nSenior Astronaut Wings\nAir Force Commendation Medal\nCongressional Space Medal of Honor (posthumous)\nNASA Exceptional Service Medal\nGolden Plate Award for Science and Exploration, 1965\nMedalha Bandeirantes va Cosmonautica\nFirefly Club Award\nTen Outstanding Young Men of the Nation, 1965\nFive Outstanding Young Texans, 1965\nHarmon Trophy, 1966\nArnold Air Society\'s John F.

As a result of his insistence that UFO sightings should not be dismissed without some form of proper scientific study, the Department set up what writer Nick Pope has described as \"arguably the most marvellously-named committee in the history of the civil service\".\n\n\n== Set-up ==\nThe Flying Saucer Working Party was set up in October 1950 by Ministry of Defence Chief Scientific Adviser Sir Henry Tizard, who felt that UFO reports should not be dismissed out of hand without some serious study.  He duly authorised the setting up of a small study team to look into the phenomenon.  The group\'s final report, published in June 1951, was released to UFO researchers Dr David Clarke and Andy Roberts in 2001 by the MOD, following requests made under the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information.\nThe Working Party concluded that all the reports they studied could be explained by one or more of the following causes: astronomical or meteorological phenomena; misidentification of aircraft, balloons, birds and the like; optical illusions and psychological delusions; deliberate hoaxes. The report ended: “We accordingly recommend very strongly that no further investigation of reported mysterious aerial phenomena be undertaken, unless and until some material evidence becomes available.”\nA detailed commentary and analysis of this material can be found at the Real UFO Project website including scans of the report and associated documents.\n\n\n== References ==', ''),

NASA released a statement in 2005 reporting that experts had examined fragments from the area and determined they were from a Russian satellite, but records of their findings were lost in the 1990s. NASA responded to court orders and Freedom of Information Act requests to search for the records. The incident gained wide notoriety in popular culture and UFOlogy, with speculations ranging from alien craft to debris from the Soviet space probe Kosmos 96, and is often referred to as \"Pennsylvania\'s Roswell.\"\n\n\n== Initial reports ==\nOn the evening of December 9, 1965, a large, brilliant fireball was seen by thousands in at least six U.S. states and Ontario, Canada. It streaked over the Detroit, Michigan – Windsor, Canada area. Reports of hot metal debris over Michigan and northern Ohio, grass fires, and sonic booms in the Pittsburgh metropolitan area were attributed to the fireball. Some people in the village of Kecksburg, about 30 miles southeast of Pittsburgh, reported something crashing in the woods, wisps of blue smoke, vibrations and a \"thump\".According to an initial story in the Greensburg Tribune-Review \"The area where the object landed was immediately sealed off on the order of U.S. Army and State Police officials, reportedly in anticipation of a \'close inspection\' of whatever may have fallen ... State Police officials there ordered the area roped off to await the expected arrival of both U.S. Army engineers and possibly, civilian scientists.\" When State troopers and Air Force personnel searched the woods, they reportedly found \"absolutely nothing\". A subsequent edition in the Tribune-Review bore the headline “Searchers Fail To Find Object”.Authorities discounted proposed explanations such as a plane crash, errant missile test, or reentering satellite debris and generally assumed it to be a meteor. Astronomer Paul Annear said the fireball was likely a meteor entering the Earth\'s atmosphere. Geophysicist George Wetherilo discounted speculations that it was debris from a satellite and agreed the reports were probably due to a meteor. Astronomers William P. Bidelman and Fred Hess said it undoubtedly was a meteor bolide.  A spokesman for the Defense Department in Washington said first reports indicated the reported fireball was a natural phenomenon.\n\n\n== Scientific articles ==\n\n\n=== Sky and Telescope ===\nSeveral articles were written about the fireball in science journals. The February 1966 issue of Sky & Telescope reported that the fireball was seen over the Detroit-Windsor area at about 4:44 p.m. EST. The Federal Aviation Administration had received 23 reports from aircraft pilots, the first starting at 4:44 p.m. A seismograph 25 miles southwest of Detroit had recorded the shock waves created by the fireball as it passed through the atmosphere. The Sky & Telescope article concluded that \"the path of the fireball extended roughly from northwest to southeast\" and ended \"in or near the western part of Lake Erie\".\n\n\n=== Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada ===\nA 1967 article by two astronomers in the Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada (JRASC) used the seismographic record to pinpoint the time of passage over the Detroit area to 4:43 p.m. In addition, they used photographs of the trail taken north of Detroit at two different locations to triangulate the trajectory of the object. They concluded that the fireball was descending at a steep angle, moving from the southwest to the northeast, and likely impacted on the northwestern shore of Lake Erie near Windsor, Ontario.\n\n\n== NASA statement ==\nIn December 2005, just before the 40th anniversary of the Kecksburg incident, NASA released a statement reporting that experts had examined metallic fragments from the area and determined they were from a Russian satellite that re-entered the atmosphere and broke up, but records of their findings were lost in the 1990s.Leslie Kean, described as \"an investigative reporter backed by the Sci-Fi Channel\", reportedly \"sued NASA under the Freedom of Information Act\" for the lost NASA records. On October 26, 2007, NASA agreed to search for those records after being ordered by a court. During the hearing, Steve McConnell, NASA\'s public liaison officer, testified that two boxes of papers from the time of the Kecksburg incident were missing. Loss of records is not a unique case for NASA; for example, the original tapes recorded during the televised Apollo 11 Moon landing were misplaced or reused.In 2008, space writer James Oberg suggested that NASA was unlikely to possess any such documents since, in his view, it was highly likely that the supposed NASA team that investigated the site were in fact Air Force personnel who identified themselves as NASA personnel, something regularly done by military personnel in civilian clothes during the 1960s. He further suggested that Kean\'s action was no more than a \"publicity stunt\" for the benefit of Kean\'s employers.According to John Ventre of MUFON and Shafton native Owen Eichler, their recent investigations have led them to speculate the object that reportedly landed in Kecksburg was \"a General Electric Mark 2 Re-entry Vehicle that had been launched by the Air Force as a spy satellite, but fell out of orbit\", however, “we need confirmation from NASA or the Air Force\".\n\n\n== Television shows ==\nIn 1990, the NBC television show Unsolved Mysteries aired an episode partially devoted to the incident. The episode suggested an extraterrestrial craft had crashed, it quoted local residents at the time who said they had found an object in the woods shaped like an acorn and about as large as a Volkswagen Beetle bearing writing resembling Egyptian hieroglyphs which was subsequently removed in a secret military operation. A prop from that show remains on display in the village.In 2003, the Sci Fi Channel aired a two-hour documentary entitled \"The New Roswell: Kecksburg Exposed\", hosted by Bryant Gumbel. During the show, Kecksburg resident John Hays said when he was a 10-year old boy, he saw \"a flat-bed truck emerging from the site near his house carrying something the “size of a VW”.The 2008, an episode of the Discovery Channel series Nazi UFO Conspiracy suggested the incident was the recovery of an alleged Nazi UFO called Die Glocke (\"The Bell\"; also known as \"The Nazi Bell\"), a claim also made by conspiracy theorist Joseph P. Farrell.In February 2009, the History Channel\'s UFO Hunters suggested a military conspiracy and cover-up related to the incident.In 2011, the History Channel\'s Ancient Aliens suggested the alleged Nazi secret weapon Die Glocke was recovered at Kecksburg, prompting a government conspiracy and cover-up.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of UFO sightings\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPittsburg Post-Gazette article by David Templeton\nSkeptic Robert Sheaffer comments on the Kecksburg case\nRoadside America article\nUFOcasebook.com Summary of case\nUFOcasebook.com copies of released NASA records\nUFOevidence.org summary and links to Kecksburg articles\nInternational UFO Reporter, 2005 article by Leslie Kean', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4f/2013_Pittsburgh_Metro_Area_SMALL.PNG');

(97, 'Shag Harbour UFO incident', 'The Shag Harbour UFO incident was the reported impact of an unknown large object into waters near Shag Harbour, a tiny fishing village in the Canadian province of Nova Scotia on October 4, 1967. The reports were investigated by various civilian (Royal Canadian Mounted Police and Canadian Coast Guard) and military (Royal Canadian Navy and Royal Canadian Air Force) agencies of the Government of Canada and the U.S. Condon Committee.\n\n\n== Pre-incident aerial phenomenon ==\n\n\n=== Air Canada flight 305 ===\nEn route to Toronto while flying over Sherbrooke and Saint-Jean, Quebec at 3658 m, from the Halifax International airport, Air Canada Capt. Pierre Charbounneau on Flight 305 pointed out to co-pilot Bob Ralph that there was something strange out the left side of the aircraft at 7:15PM. In his report the captain reported an object tracking along on a parallel course a few miles away. He describes it as a brilliantly lit, rectangular object with a string of smaller lights trailing the object. At 7:19, the pilots noticed a sizeable silent explosion near the large object; two minutes later, a second explosion occurred which faded to a blue cloud around the object.\n\n\n=== Yellow object ===\nDarrel Dorey, his sister Annette, and his mother were sitting on their front porch in Mahone Bay, when they noticed a large object manoeuvring above the southwestern horizon. The next day Darrell wrote a letter to RCAF Greenwood Base Commander asking what was flying over the water that evening, as he had never seen anything like it.\n\n\n=== MV Nickerson of Sambro, Nova Scotia ===\nWhile standing at the wheelhouse of his vessel, Capt. Leo Howard Mersey was looking at four blips on his Decca radar that were stationary. When he looked up about 28km from the vessel’s windows he could see the four bright objects situated in a roughly rectangular formation. The entire crew of nearly twenty fishermen stood on deck and watched the object in the northeastern sky. Mersey radioed the rescue coordination centre and the harbour master in Halifax asking for an explanation, and filed a report with the Lunenburg RCMP outlining his sighting when they arrived in port.\n\n\n=== Halifax Harbour sightings ===\nThe Chronicle-Herald and local radio stations reported a glowing object that had been seen by many people who had called their newsroom. They reported witnessing strange glowing objects flying around Halifax at around 10:00 PM. \n\n\n== Initial events ==\n\nOn the night of October 4, 1967, at about 11:20 p.m. Atlantic Daylight Time, it was reported that something had crashed into the waters of Shag Harbour. At least eleven people saw a low-flying lit object head towards the harbour.  Multiple witnesses reported hearing a whistling sound \"like a bomb,\" then a \"whoosh,\" and finally a loud bang. The object was never officially identified, and was therefore referred to as an unidentified flying object (UFO) in Government of Canada documents.  The Canadian military became involved in a subsequent rescue/recovery effort. The initial report was made by local resident Laurie Wickens and four of his friends. Driving through Shag Harbour, on Highway 3, they spotted a large object descending into the waters off the harbour. Attaining a better vantage point, Wickens and his friends saw an object floating 250 to 300 m (820 to 980 ft) offshore in the waters of Shag Harbour. Wickens contacted the RCMP detachment in Barrington Passage and reported he had seen a large airplane or small airliner crash into the waters off Shag Harbour.\n\n\n== Search and rescue efforts ==\nAssuming an aircraft had crashed, within about 15 minutes, 2 RCMP officers arrived at the scene. Concerned for survivors, the RCMP detachment contacted the Rescue Coordination Centre (RCC) in Halifax to advise them of the situation, and ask if any aircraft were missing. Before any attempt at rescue could be made, the object started to sink and disappeared from view.\nA rescue mission was quickly assembled. Within half an hour of the crash, local fishing boats went out to the crash site in the waters of the Gulf of Maine off Shag Harbour to look for survivors. No survivors, bodies or debris were taken, either by the fishermen or by a Canadian Coast Guard search and rescue cutter, which arrived about an hour later from nearby Clark\'s Harbour.\nBy the next morning, RCC Halifax had determined that no aircraft were missing. While still tasked with the search, the captain of the Canadian Coast Guard cutter received a radio message from RCC Halifax that all commercial, private and military aircraft were accounted for along the eastern seaboard, in both Atlantic Canada and New England.\nThe same morning, RCC Halifax also sent a priority telex to the \"Air Desk\" at Royal Canadian Air Force headquarters in Ottawa, which handled all civilian and military UFO sightings, informing them of the crash and that all conventional explanations such as aircraft, flares, etc. had been dismissed.  Therefore, this was labeled a \"UFO Report.\"  The head of the Air Desk then sent another priority telex to the Royal Canadian Navy headquarters concerning the \"UFO Report\" and recommended an underwater search be mounted.  The RCN in turn sent another priority telex tasking Fleet Diving Unit Atlantic with carrying out the search.\nTwo days after the incident had been observed, a detachment of RCN divers from Fleet Diving Unit Atlantic was assembled and for the next three days they combed the seafloor of the Gulf of Maine off Shag Harbor looking for an object. The final report said no trace of an object was found.\n\n\n== Documents ==\nThere is a summary of the event from the Department of National Defence files located at Library and Archives Canada.\n\n\n== Condon Committee ==\nThe Shag Harbour reports were investigated by the Condon Committee.\n\n\n== Press coverage ==\nThe Shag Harbour reports received extensive front page coverage in the Halifax Chronicle-Herald.  The paper ran a headline story on October 7 titled, \"Could Be Something Concrete in Shag Harbor UFO — RCAF.\"  The article, by Ray MacLeod, included witness descriptions of an alleged object and crash, the Royal Canadian Air Force\'s (RCAF) search and rescue effort, and the Royal Canadian Navy\'s (RCN) underwater search that was underway, including three additional divers from Fleet Diving Unit Atlantic.\n\nThe head of the RCAF\'s \"Air Desk\" in Ottawa, Squadron Leader Bain, who recommended the RCN undertake an underwater search, was also quoted, saying the RCAF was “very interested” in the matter.  “We get hundreds of reports every week, but the Shag Harbor incident is one of the few where we may get something concrete on it.”\nThe article also mentioned UFO reports that immediately preceded the incident, including one from a woman in Halifax around 10:00 p.m.\nThe Chronicle-Herald ran another story on October 9 titled \"UFO Search Called Off,\" stating that the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN) had ended \"an intensive undersea search for the mysterious unidentified flying object that disappeared into the ocean here Wednesday night.\"  As to what was found, the RCN stated, \"Not a trace... not a clue... not a bit of anything.\" The story of the search being called off for an alleged \"mysterious\" \"dark object\" was also carried by the Canadian Press in some other Canadian newspapers.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Further reading ===\nCanada\'s Unidentified Flying Objects: The Search for the Unknown at Library and Archives Canada\n\n\n== External links ==\nDetailed Canadian government topological maps of Shag Harbour region', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/45/RCMP_67-400-23-X.jpg'),
(98, 'Belgian UFO wave', 'The Belgian UFO wave was a series of purported sightings of triangular UFOs in Belgium, which lasted from 29 November 1989 to April 1990. Months after the event, many people claimed to have witnessed the object, but no pictures, videos or any other type of proof was ever provided.\n\n\n== The sightings ==\nThe Belgian UFO wave began in November 1989. Reports were filed, most many weeks after the events. No witnesses managed to take any photographic evidence of the event. Many of the reports related a large object flying at low altitude. Some reports also stated that the craft was of a flat, triangular shape, with lights underneath.The Belgian UFO wave peaked with the events of the night of 30–31 March 1990. On that night, one unknown object was tracked on radar, and two Belgian Air Force F-16s were sent to investigate, with neither pilot reporting seeing the object. No reports were received from the public on the date. But over the next 2 weeks reports from 143 people who claimed to have witnessed the object were received, all of them after the event. Over the ensuing months, many others claimed to have witnessed these events as well. Following the incident, the Belgian Air Force released a report detailing the events of that night.\nAt around 23:00 on 30 March, the supervisor for the Control Reporting Center (CRC) at Glons received reports that three unusual lights were seen moving towards Thorembais-Gembloux, which lies to the southeast of Brussels. Glons CRC requested the Wavre gendarmerie send a patrol to confirm the sighting.\nApproximately 10 minutes later, some later reports stated that a second set of lights were seen, moving towards the first triangle. Traffic Center Control at Semmerzake tracked one object only on its radar, and an order to scramble two F-16 fighters from Beauvechain Air Base was given. Throughout this time, in reports after the event, some people claim that the phenomenon was visible from the ground, describing the whole formation as maintaining their relative positions while moving slowly across the sky. \nOver the next hour, the two scrambled F-16s attempted nine separate interceptions of the targets. On three occasions, they managed to obtain a radar lock for a few seconds, but these were later shown to be Radar-locks on each other. The pilots never reported seeing any of the claimed sightings, saw none of the claimed manoeuvres, and never got a lock on any objects apart from the other F16. The other contacts were all found to be the result of a well-known atmospheric interference called Bragg scattering\nAfter 00:30, radar contact became much more sporadic and the final confirmed lock took place at 00:40. Following several further unconfirmed contacts, the F-16s eventually returned to base shortly after 01:00.\nMembers of the Wavre gendarmerie who had been sent to confirm the original report, describe four lights now being arranged in a square formation, all making short jerky movements, before gradually losing their luminosity and disappearing in four separate directions at around 01:30. They also reported that a low engine noise was heard and that it seemed to have a stick coming out one end with a turbine on it, which many have claimed shows it was a Helicopter they saw.\n\n\n== Real Photograph ==\n\nIn April 1990, a hoax photo of a triangular object upon which three lights are visible at each corner was taken by an anonymous photographer. Since then, a man named Patrick M. publicly said that it was a hoax picture by him.Experts say there is no background in the photograph and no element that would allow calculation of  the object\'s size or distance from the camera. Wim van Utrecht has reproduced a copy of the photograph with devices. A computer graphics simulation method to reproduce the photograph was developed by a Belgian mathematician, Thierry Veyt at The University of Liège Laboratory of Astrophysics, wherein the apparent \"shake\" motion, that results in the lights of the craft appearing blurred or out of focus in the photograph contradicts eye-witness statements. This, along with the anonymity of the photographer and fact that the image was not produced publicly until 4 months after the alleged event, brings the authenticity of the image into question.\nFor 20 years, the ufological organization Société belge d\'étude des phénomènes spatiaux (SOBEPS) claimed that this picture was genuine. But on 26 July 2011, in an interview for RTL, a Belgian TV channel, Patrick M. explained that it was a hoax.In his September 27, 2016 Skeptoid podcast episode titled \"The Belgian UFO Wave,\" author Brian Dunning discussed the photographic evidence and reported that the\n\nsingle photograph turns out to be emblematic of the quality of all the evidence that characterized the Belgian UFO Wave. In 2011, a guy named Patrick Maréchal invited Belgian reporters to his home to show them what he and some buddies had done at work one day when the media hype had been at its peak. They took a sheet of styrofoam, cut it into a triangle, painted it black, embedded a flashlight in each corner, then hung it from a string. Maréchal still had tons of photos that they\'d taken trying to get that one that was just right, and that fooled the world.\n\n\n== Explanations ==\nIn 1992, about three years after the first sighting, which occurred on 29 November 1989, in Eupen, Marc Hallet wrote an essay about the Belgian UFO wave criticizing the work done by the SOBEPS: La Vague OVNI Belge ou le triomphe de la désinformation, arguing that this UFOlogical organisation was spreading misinformation in the media. Hallet\'s thesis is that the Belgian UFO wave was mostly a mass delusion, boosted by the work done by the SOBEPS. This mass delusion would have followed Philip J. Klass\'s law: Once news coverage leads the public to believe that UFOs may be in the vicinity, there are numerous natural and man-made objects which, especially seen at night, can take on unusual characteristics in the minds of hopeful viewers. Their UFO reports in turn add to the mass excitement, which encourages still more observers to watch for UFOs. This situation feeds upon itself until such time as the media lose interest in the subject, and then the « flap » quickly runs out of steam..In 1993, Pierre Magain and Marc Remy published an article in Physicalia Magazine, in which their conclusions don\'t match those from the SOBEPS. They also state that the Belgian UFO wave would be better studied by people in the human sciences than by physicists.\nIn The Belgian UFO Wave of 1989–1992 – A Neglected Hypothesis, Renaud Leclet & co. discuss the fact that some sightings can be explained by helicopters. Most witnesses reported that the objects were silent. This report argues that the lack of noise could be due to the engine noise in the witnesses\' automobiles, or strong natural wind blowing away from the witnesses.In his article The Beginning of the Belgian UFO wave, Jean-Michel Abrassart argues that the beginning of the wave does not contradict the psychosocial hypothesis, contrary to what the SOBEPS claimed in his work. In an article published on his website in 2011, The Belgian Wave and the photos of Ramillies, Auguste Meessen replied to several criticisms (by Roger Paquay and Jean-Michel Abrassart) and argues that, according to him, the Belgian UFO wave is completely unexplained. Roger Paquay and Jean-Michel Abrassart both wrote rebuttals to the Belgian physicist\'s article.\nIn \"The Belgian UFO Wave\" Skeptoid podcast episode, Brian Dunning discussed the F-16 chase and reported that\n\nThe pilots also got intermittent contact with objects, but they appeared and disappeared and moved up and down too fast, including going underground. The pilots never saw anything at all. SOBEPS reported that they obtained radar lock on targets nine times; but the Belgian military only reported three such locks, and upon analyzing the data, all three radar locks were on each other. The other contacts were all found to be the result of a well-known atmospheric interference called Bragg scattering.\nRegarding the \"wave\" of eye-witness reports and lack of photographic evidence, Dunning concludes\n\nYou read a story in the paper that a UFO was seen flying over your town a night or two ago. You remember that you saw something you took for a bright star or an airplane, thought nothing of it at the time, but this amazing new story makes you realize that what you saw must have been this UFO. You and I might not necessarily make that connection, but it\'s perfectly reasonable that a lot of people will; and so they follow the instructions in the newspaper article and send a report to SOBEPS. With so many articles over a period of years in a small country, it\'s no great surprise that SOBEPS reported they eventually received as many as 2,600 in all. The 143 reports Meessen claims for the original November 29 incident were indeed received, but only after more than a week of aggressive and repeated solicitation in the mass media. It is only much later retellings of the story that wrongly assume all 2,600 were reported as people were watching the F-16s chase the UFOs, or that all 143 initial reports came independently on that first night. All the reports were after the fact, and were only made after prompting and solicitation by SOBEPS and the media.\nIt was simply a psycho-social phenomenon, which is why there is no evidence and only the one questionable photograph. If 13,500 people did all actually see something that they took for a UFO at the time, I guarantee you that more than just a single photograph would have resulted.\n\n\n== Books ==\nVague OVNI sur la Belgique (UFO wave over Belgium), written by the defunct SOBEPS organisation.\nSekret Machines: Chasing Shadows 1, Written by A.J.

(99, 'Reported UFO sightings in the United Kingdom', 'This is a list of notable alleged sightings of unidentified flying objects or UFOs in the UK. Many more sightings have become known since the gradual release of the MoD UFO sighting reports by the National Archives in 2008. In recent years there have been many sightings of groups of slowly moving lights in the night sky, which can be easily explained as Chinese lanterns. Project Condign, undertaken from 1997 to 2000, concluded that all the investigated sightings of unidentified aerial phenomena in the U.K. could be assigned to misidentified but explicable objects, or poorly understood natural phenomena.\n\n\n== 12th century ==\n1113: Religious pilgrims in southwest England reported seeing a glowing fire-belching \"dragon\" emerge from the sea, flying into the air, and disappearing into the sky.\n\n\n== 13th century ==\nJanuary 1254: In St. Albans, England, a scribe wrote of a glowing floating light, thus recorded it, \"...in serene sky and clear air, with stars shining and the Moon eight days old, there suddenly appeared in the sky a kind of large ship elegantly shaped, well equipped and of marvelous color.\"\n1290: Friars of Byland Abbey, described of \"a flat, round shining silvery object\" flying overhead of them.\n\n\n== 20th century ==\nFebruary 1942: A woman named Eileen Arnold was walking down Cheltenham high street when she suddenly experienced an altered state of consciousness as she became \"tuned into another reality\". She became aware of a large oval shape moving slowly above the rooftops.  She stated that it radiated light from holes in its side and had quills which detached one by one, also emitting light.  Following this, Eileen believed she had numerous psychic experiences.\nSeptember 1942: Albert Lancaster believes he was abducted by aliens while working as a guard at a radar site near Newbiggin-on-Sea, Northumbria. He claimed to have a sudden urge to go outside followed by a \"strange impulse to look at the sky.\" He claims he saw a glowing light surrounded by dark mist and, assuming it was a German weapon, went to raise the alarm before being struck by a beam of light from the cloud followed by a floating sensation then becoming aware he was back at his post.  Following this experience he believed he had psychic powers for a period of time.\n5 August 1944: According to records released on 5 August 2010, British wartime prime minister Winston Churchill banned the reporting for 50 years of an alleged UFO incident because of fears it could create mass panic.  Reports given to Churchill claimed the incident allegedly involved a Royal Air Force (RAF) reconnaissance plane returning from a mission in France or Germany toward the end of the Second World War. It was over or near the English coastline when it was allegedly suddenly intercepted by a strange metallic object that matched the aircraft\'s course and speed for a time before accelerating away and disappearing.  The plane\'s crew were reported to have photographed the object, which they said had \"hovered noiselessly\" near the aircraft, before moving off.  According to the documents, details of the cover-up emerged when the man wrote to the government in 1999 seeking to find out more about the incident. He described how his grandfather, who served with the RAF in the Second World War, was present when Churchill and U.S. General Dwight Eisenhower discussed how to deal with the UFO encounter.  The files come from more than 5,000 pages of UFO reports and letters and drawings from members of the public, as well as questions raised by Members of Parliament in the Parliament of the United Kingdom.  They are available to download for free for a month from The National Archives website.\n1 June 1950: A Gloster Meteor at RAF Tangmere passes a flying saucer lit up with lights; this was described as \'Britain\'s first flying saucer\'. The object was reported to be shining, revolving, and disc-like at 20,000 ft at 14.30, flying eastwards over the Portsmouth area. RAF Tangmere asked the radar station at RAF Wartling in Sussex if it had seen the object, and it had on its PPI screen. It led to the setting up of the Flying Saucer Working Party.\n14 August 1950: A 50 ft-diameter disc UFO is seen over the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE) at 11.27 by an experienced pilot F/Lt. Hubbard. He claimed to see another similar object on 5 September 1950 at 16.09.\n14–25 September 1952: Operation Mainbrace - many UFOs were observed. On 19 September at 11 am a silver disc-shaped object followed a Gloster Meteor returning to RAF Topcliffe, and seen by observers on the ground. It rotated whilst hovering. It then travelled towards the west at high speed. On 21 September, six RAF planes followed a spherical object over the North Sea. It followed one of the planes back to the base. It was the front-page headline on 20 September 1952 on the Yorkshire Evening Press and on 21 September 1952 on the Sunday Dispatch\n21 October 1952: Two RAF pilots in a Gloster Meteor see three disc-shaped objects at 35,000 ft in the Little Rissington UFO incident.\n3 November 1953: Terry Johnson and Geoffrey Smythe in an RAF de Havilland Vampire saw a UFO over RAF West Malling.\n14 October 1954: Flt Lt James Salandin of the Royal Auxiliary Air Force, flying in a No. 604 Squadron RAF Gloster Meteor F8 from RAF North Weald, narrowly missed two UFOs over Southend-on-Sea at around 4:30 pm at 16,000 ft. The objects were circular with one being coloured silver and the other gold. He narrowly avoided having a head-on collision with the silver object.\n17 July 1955 at noon: on King Harold\'s Way in Bexleyheath in the London Borough of Bexley a 30-foot-wide saucer-shaped object was seen to hover a few feet above a street in broad daylight by Margaret Fry and her doctor on a very hot cloudless day. Car engines nearby to the object stalled. It was seen by around thirty people and made a humming noise and landed at the junction of Ashbourne Road and Whitfield Road. It hovered over Bedonwell Primary School (now Bedonwell Junior School) for around one minute. It finally shot off into the sky. Another UFO had landed a few streets away at the same time. A similar object had been seen in Bexleyheath in 1952.\n13 August 1956: Lakenheath-Bentwaters incident - 12 to 15 objects were picked up by USAF radar over East Anglia. One object was tracked at more than 4,000 mph by USAF GCA radar at RAF Bentwaters. The objects sometimes travelled in formation, then converged to form a larger object and performed sharp turns. One object was tracked for 26 miles which then hovered for five minutes then flew off. One object at 10 pm was tracked at 12,000 mph. RAF de Havilland Venoms from RAF Waterbeach had sightings of the objects.\n22 September 1956 at 3 pm: a large, spherical glass-like 80-foot-diameter object was seen over the Cleethorpes coast for over an hour and also seen on radar from RAF Manby. RAF planes approached the object and it flew off.\n4 April 1957: West Freugh incident - a large object was seen on radar at RAF West Freugh near Stranraer at 50,000 ft which was stationary for 10 minutes over the Irish Sea. It moved vertically to 70,000 ft and was also tracked by radar at Ardwell. The object did an \'impossible\' sharp turn and was described as being as large as a ship, bigger than a normal aircraft.\n20 May 1957: Milton Torres 1957 UFO Encounter - a USAF F-86D Sabre based at RAF Manston intercepted an object over East Anglia.\nLate spring (from 19 May) and early summer 1965: Many sightings of UFOs were seen in the Warminster area. Cley Hill, near to the town, has since been a place for frequent sightings.\n28 April 1967: a dome-shaped object was sighted over Brixham in Devon at around 1,600 ft at around noon for approximately one hour. A door was seen in the side of the object and it had been seen by the HM Coastguard station at Berry Head. There were 362 UFO sightings in 1967: there had only been 95 in 1966.\n1967: Clapham Wood experienced a rash of UFO sightings and unexplained events during the 1960s and continuing into the 1970s.\n24 October 1967: Devon Flying Cross UFO - PCs Roger Willey (from Okehampton) and Clifford Waycott (from Winkleigh) were driving from Holsworthy to Hatherleigh along the A3072 at 4 am. They saw a bright object in the shape of a cross at tree-top height at a distance of about 40 metres. They followed the \'pulsating\' object for about fifteen minutes along the road at speeds up to 80 mph. The object was described as being star-spangled like \'looking through wet glass\'. At 4:23 am it was joined by a second object. A motorist, Mr Christopher Garner of Hatherleigh, had also seen it and thought he was having a nightmare. The object disappeared around 5 am having been followed for fourteen miles. It was attributed to Venus as were other similar sightings that same month.\n25 October 1967: Sussex flying cross - policemen in five police cars across East Sussex reported a bright flying cross in the early hours, with the first sighting at 4:45 am at Halland. The other sightings were a few minutes later.\n26 October 1967: 54-year-old Mr Angus Brooks, a former BOAC administrator for its Comet fleet, of Owermoigne was walking on Moigns Down at 11:25 am near Holworth close to the Dorset coast (a mile south of Owermoigne on the A354) with his two dogs in a force 8 gale and took shelter in a hollow. He then saw a circular translucent craft with a \'girder\' to the front and three \'girders\' pointing to the rear. The girders rearranged to form a cross shape around the central 25 ft diameter disc and then began to spin. Twenty two minutes later, the \'girders\' went back to their original position and the craft sped off in a north-east direction.\n8 September 1970: William Schaffner intercepted an unknown object over the North Sea. His BAC Lightning was later retrieved from the sea.\n1971: It is claimed that unidentified silent craft were regularly seen by two school children near the coastal village of Muchalls, Scotland (but not in the village itself), from 1971 onwards. These events are claimed to have continued night after night for many years. The phenomena are reputed to have continued at least until 1991 when some aspects of the apparitions were also filmed in the area.\n16 October 1973: It is alleged that Gabriella Versacci was taken on board an alien space ship near a small village in Somerset, England. She was physically inspected when strapped down to an examination table.\n23 January 1974: A UFO allegedly crashed at Berwyn Mountain, Wales.  The event coincided with an earthquake.\nJune 1976: An official British Airways film taken during one of the Concorde\'s flights over southern England depicts a white light which turns around the fuselage of the aircraft. A later analysis of the film presented in a UFO documentary indicated that the light was an artifact of the video camera.\n4 February 1977: A cigar-shaped craft is alleged to have landed next to Broad Haven Primary School and witnessed by 14 school children who saw a silver creature.\n22 November 1978 at 17:15 : Elsie Oakensen of Church Stowe, south of Weedon Bec in Northamptonshire was driving down the A5 from Weedon southwards to her home. She saw two bright lights, one green and one red and could make out a dumbbell shaped object. Turning off the A5 to her village, her recently serviced car cut out twice. Then she noticed the sky was black and a brilliant white beam of light shone on the road ahead, then the normal colour of the sky returned but she could not account for 15 minutes of her time.\n9 November 1979: Bob Taylor, a forestry worker had an alleged encounter with a UFO in a clearing on Dechmont Law in Livingston, West Lothian, which he claimed dragged him along the ground. It is considered one of the most significant Close Encounters in Scotland.\n29 November 1980 at 5 am: Alan Godfrey, an on-duty police officer, claims to have been abducted by an alien space craft in Todmorden in West Yorkshire. A strange luminescent object had been spotted by other local police officers at the same time.\nDecember 1980: A series of reported sightings of unexplained lights and objects in the sky, and the alleged landing of an extraterrestrial spacecraft occurred at Rendlesham Forest, Suffolk, England on 26 December. It is perhaps the most famous UFO event to have happened in Britain, ranking amongst the best-known UFO events worldwide.\n12 August 1983: A 77-year-old gentleman, Alfred Burtoo, was quietly fishing on the Basingstoke Canal when a UFO landed nearby. Two humanoid beings beckoned him onto their disc-shaped vehicle and he was medically examined by English-speaking creatures. He was \'rejected\' by the creatures because he was \'too old\'.\n26 April 1984: Several people reported a UFO over Stanmore in north-west London, and was seen by two police officers.\n13 October 1984: Several people see a flying saucer over Waterloo Bridge in London\n19 November 1987 at 7 pm: the Black Country UFO - a large UFO was seen at close quarters hovering over houses in Brierley Hill.\n1 December 1987: Philip Spencer (not his real name), a retired policeman, took a picture on Ilkley Moor, which is claimed to be of an alien creature, and then saw a white coloured craft leaving the area. The object in the photograph was examined by Kodak Laboratories at Hemel Hempstead and they decided that the object was not superimposed. This was one of the few British close encounters of the third kind. Under hypnosis he claimed to have been abducted and medically examined.\n4 August 1990 at 9 pm: a 75-foot-wide diamond object was seen by the pilot of an RAF Harrier at Calvine,  20 miles north of Pitlochry in Perth and Kinross. It appeared to hover for 10 minutes above the A9 near Calvine.\n21 April 1991: airline pilot Achille Zaghetti from Grosseto, Tuscany, in an Alitalia McDonnell Douglas MD-80 on a flight from Milan to Heathrow saw a three-metre-long khaki-coloured object over Lydd in Kent at 22,000 ft about 300m away. It was seen on radar.\n1992: James Walker noticed unidentified lights in the sky over Bonnybridge, the town became the scene of numerous UFO sightings. It forms part of the \"Falkirk Triangle\", an area stretching from Stirling to Fife and the outskirts of Edinburgh. Ufologists claim that Bonnybridge is the world\'s number one UFO location, with an average of around 300 sightings a year.\nMarch 1992: Isabella Sloggett, and her daughter Carol, were walking towards Bonnybridge and saw a blue light hovering above the road in front of them. A UFO landed, and a door on the craft opened.\n1993, 31 March: Multiple witnesses across south-west and west England saw a large triangular-shaped UFO speeding across the sky leaving a luminous wake. Analysis of the sightings concluded that the object was the re-entry of a Russian booster rocket combined with a later sighting of a police helicopter.\n26 September 1993: a large black triangle is seen over Bakewell in the Derbyshire Dales at 21.30.\n19 February 1994: a metallic disc-shaped object was filmed over Craigluscar Reservoir near Dunfermline in Scotland by Ian McPherson.\n6 January 1995: pilots aboard a Boeing 737 on British Airways Flight BA5061 from Milan saw an object on their descent to Manchester at 4,000 ft when over the southern Pennines. The reports have been attributed to a bright fireball.\n5 October 1996: the Wash Incident - in the early hours a rotating UFO was seen over The Wash by Skegness and Boston police officers, although later (partially) explained as a radar echo of St Botolph\'s Church. The visual sightings were explained as celestial objects.\n24 March 1997: At 22:00 on the Dark Peak, Howden Moor, two sonic booms were heard over the area, and recorded at this time although the RAF denied having supersonic aircraft in the area. They later helped in the night-long search for a crashed aircraft, using helicopters and sniffer dogs from the police with 150 Mountain Rescue volunteers. No wreckage was found. A triangle-shaped UFO had been seen an hour before the sonic booms in the local area.\n\n\n== 21st century ==\n\n5 October 2000: A woman named Sharon Rowlands from Bonsall, Derbyshire claimed to have seen a large luminous pink object hovering and rotating over a nearby field. She filmed the object on a camcorder.\n26 May 2004: a 60 metre long cigar-shaped object was seen over Torquay. Local teenagers later came forward to admit the sighting was caused by their toy inflatable airship.11 September 2004 Archives hold evidence of E/T never investigated by authorities.

(100, 'Black triangle (UFO)', 'Black triangles are a class of unidentified flying object (UFO), with certain common features which have reportedly been observed during the 20th and 21st centuries. Media reports of black triangles originally came from the United States and United Kingdom.Reports generally describe this class of UFOs as large, silent, black triangular objects hovering or slowly cruising at low altitudes over cities and highways. Sightings usually take place at night. These objects are often described as having pulsing colored lights that appear at each corner of the triangle.Black triangle UFOs have been found to be visible to radar, as was the case with the famous Belgian UFO wave. During these incidents, two Belgian Air Force F-16s attempted to intercept the objects only to be outmaneuvered; a key conclusion of the Project Condign report was that no attempt should be made on the part of civilian or RAF Air Defence aircraft to outmaneuver these objects except to place them astern to mitigate the risk of collision. This entire Belgian UFO wave, however,  has been disputed by skeptics.\n\n\n== UK Ministry of Defence Report Findings ==\n\nDeclassified research (subject to a Freedom of Information request) from the UK Ministry of Defence report Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) in the UK Air Defence Region, code named Project Condign and released to the public in 2006, draws several conclusions as to the origin of \"black triangle\" UFO sightings.\nTheir researchers conclude that most, if not all, \"black triangle\" UFOs are formations of electrical plasma, the interaction of which creates mysterious energy fields that both refract light and produce vivid hallucinations in witnesses that are in close proximity.\nFurther it suggests that \"the majority, if not all, of the hitherto unexplained reports may well be due to atmospheric gaseous electrically charged buoyant plasmas\"  which emit charged fields with the capability of inducing vivid hallucinations and psychological effects in witnesses and are \"capable of being transported at enormous speeds under the influence and balance of electrical charges in the atmosphere.\" The researchers note that plasmas may be formed by more than one set of weather and electrically charged conditions, while \"at least some\" events are likely to be triggered by meteor re-entry in scenarios where meteors neither burn up completely nor impact, but rather break up in the atmosphere to form such a charged plasma. These plasma formations are also theorized to have the effect of refracting light between themselves, producing the appearance of a black polygonal shape with the lights at the corners caused by self-generated plasma coloration (similar to the Aurora Borealis).The report states: \"Occasionally and perhaps exceptionally, it seems that a field with, as yet, undetermined characteristics, can exist between certain charged buoyant objects in loose formation, such that, depending on the viewing aspect, the intervening space between them forms an area (viewed as a shape, often triangular) from which the reflection of light does not occur. This is a key finding in the attribution of what have frequently been reported as black \'craft,\' often triangular and even up to hundreds of feet in length.\"\nThese plasma formations also have the effect through \"magnetic, electric or electromagnetic (or even unknown field), appears to emanate from some of the buoyant charged masses. Local fields of this type have been medically proven to cause responses in the temporal lobes of the human brain. These result in the observer sustaining his or her own vivid, but mainly incorrect, description of what is experienced. This is suggested to be a key factor in influencing the more extreme reports found in the media and are clearly believed by the \'victims.\'Recently un-redacted sections of the report state that Russian, former Soviet republic, and Chinese authorities have made a co-ordinated effort to understand the UAP topic and that Russian investigators have measured (or at least detected) \'fields\' which are reported to have caused human effects when they are located close to the phenomena. According to the Ministry of Defence researchers, Russian scientists have connected their UAP work with plasmas and the wider potential use of plasmas and may have done \"considerably more work (than is evident from open sources)\" on military applications, for example using UAP-type radiated fields to affect humans, and the possibility of producing and launching plasmas as decoys.On March 30, 1993, multiple witnesses across south-west and west England saw a large black triangle at low speeds. Analysis of the sightings by Nick Pope concluded that the object moved in a north-easterly course from Cornwall to Shropshire over a period of approximately 6 hours.\nThe sightings report clearly visible objects over densely populated areas and highways, mostly in the United States and Britain, but other parts of the world as well. A geographic distribution of U.S. sightings has been correlated by a currently inactive American-based investigative organization, the National Institute for Discovery Science, which led to a July 2002 report which suggested that the craft may belong to the U.S. Air Force; however, a subsequent report in August 2004 by the same organization (NIDS) found that the rash of sightings did not conform to previous deployment of black project aircraft and that the objects\' origins and agendas were unknown.\n\n\n== Other sightings ==\n\n\n=== 1561 Nuremberg Celestial Phenomenon ===\nThe 1561 celestial phenomenon over Nuremberg was a mass sighting of unidentified flying objects or celestial phenomena over Nuremberg, Germany. A broadsheet news article by Hans Glaser on the event reports an aerial battle between various odd-shaped objects, including the appearance of “something like a black spear, very long and thick”. This may or may not be an early reference to the “black triangle” UFO.\n\n\n=== Belgian sightings ===\n\nThe Belgian UFO wave began in November 1989. The events of 29 November were documented by over thirty different groups of witnesses, and three separate groups of police officers. All of the reports related a large object flying at low altitude. The craft was of a flat, triangular shape, with lights underneath. This giant craft did not make a sound as it slowly moved across the landscape of Belgium. There was free sharing of information as the Belgian populace tracked this craft as it moved from the town of Liege to the border of the Netherlands and Germany.In The Belgian UFO Wave of 1989–1992 – A Neglected Hypothesis, Renaud Leclet & co. discuss the fact that some sightings can be explained by helicopters. Most witnesses reported that the objects were silent. This report argues that the lack of noise could be due to the engine noise in the witnesses\' automobiles, or strong natural wind blowing away from the witnesses.In his September 27, 2016 Skeptoid podcast episode titled \"The Belgian UFO Wave,\" scientific skeptic author Brian Dunning evaluated several aspects of the Belgian black triangle sightings:\n\nRegarding the supposed radar locks by F-16s, Dunning statedThe pilots also got intermittent contact with objects, but they appeared and disappeared and moved up and down too fast, including going underground. The pilots never saw anything at all. SOBEPS reported that they obtained radar lock on targets nine times; but the Belgian military only reported three such locks, and upon analyzing the data, all three radar locks were on each other. The other contacts were all found to be the result of a well-known atmospheric interference called Bragg scattering.\nRegarding the single black triangle photograph, Dunning statedthe single photograph turns out to be emblematic of the quality of all the evidence that characterized the Belgian UFO Wave. In 2011, a guy named Patrick Maréchal invited Belgian reporters to his home to show them what he and some buddies had done at work one day when the media hype had been at its peak. They took a sheet of styrofoam, cut it into a triangle, painted it black, embedded a flashlight in each corner, then hung it from a string. Maréchal still had tons of photos that they\'d taken trying to get that one that was just right, and that fooled the world\nRegarding the \"wave\" of eye-witness reports and lack of photographic evidence, Dunning concludedYou read a story in the paper that a UFO was seen flying over your town a night or two ago. You remember that you saw something you took for a bright star or an airplane, thought nothing of it at the time, but this amazing new story makes you realize that what you saw must have been this UFO. You and I might not necessarily make that connection, but it\'s perfectly reasonable that a lot of people will; and so they follow the instructions in the newspaper article and send a report to SOBEPS. With so many articles over a period of years in a small country, it\'s no great surprise that SOBEPS reported they eventually received as many as 2,600 in all. The 143 reports Meessen claims for the original November 29 incident were indeed received, but only after more than a week of aggressive and repeated solicitation in the mass media. It is only much later retellings of the story that wrongly assume all 2,600 were reported as people were watching the F-16s chase the UFOs, or that all 143 initial reports came independently on that first night. All the reports were after the fact, and were only made after prompting and solicitation by SOBEPS and the media. It was simply a psycho-social phenomenon, which is why there is no evidence and only the one questionable photograph. If 13,500 people did all actually see something that they took for a UFO at the time, I guarantee you that more than just a single photograph would have resulted.\n\n\n=== Phoenix Lights incident ===\n\nOne of the more famous appearances of these craft was during the event known as the \"Phoenix Lights\", where multiple unidentified objects, many of them black triangles, were spotted by the residents of Phoenix, Arizona and videotaped by both the local media and residents with camcorders across multiple evenings beginning on Thursday, March 13, 1997. Some lights drifted as low as 1000 feet and moved far too slowly for conventional aircraft and too silently for helicopters. Some of the lights appeared to group up in a giant \"V\" formation that lingered above the city for several minutes. Many residents reported one triangle to be over a mile wide that drifted slowly over their houses blocking out the stars of the night sky. Other reports indicated the craft were spotted flying away from Phoenix as far away as Las Vegas, Nevada and Los Angeles, California.\nAn official report made by the Air Force about the incident concluded that the military had been testing flares launched from conventional aircraft during that time. Eyewitnesses confirmed military jets were scrambled from nearby Luke Air Force Base, but instead of launching flares, they were seen chasing after some of the objects.\nThe next few nights, in an attempt to recreate the incident, local pilots flew prop-planes over the city in a \"V\" formation, but the sounds of their engines were easily heard. The original lights made no sound. Flares were also deployed above Phoenix.\n\n\n=== 2000 – Southern Illinois incident ===\nThe \"St. Clair Triangle\", \"UFO Over Illinois\", \"Southern Illinois UFO\", or \"Highland, Illinois UFO\" sighting occurred on January 5, 2000 over the towns of Highland, Dupo, Lebanon, Shiloh, Summerfield, Millstadt, and O\'Fallon, Illinois, beginning shortly after 4:00 am. Five on-duty police officers around these locales, along with various other eyewitnesses, sighted and reported a massive, silent, triangular craft operating at an unusual treetop level altitude and speeds. One of the police officers even managed to get a single, yet ambiguous polaroid photograph of the object. The incident was examined in various television shows including the ABC special Seeing is Believing with Peter Jennings, an hour-long Discovery Channel special UFOs Over Illinois, an episode of the Syfy series Proof Positive and a half-hour-long independent documentary titled The Edge of Reality: Illinois UFO, January 5, 2000 by Darryl Barker Productions.\nSufjan Stevens sang about this incident in the song \"Concerning the UFO Sighting Near Highland, Illinois\" on his 2005 album Illinois.\n\n\n=== 2004–2006 – Tinley Park Lights ===\nThree red lights hovered in a triangular formation were seen by several witnesses in Tinley Park and Oak Forest, Illinois, on August 21, 2004, two months later on October 31, 2004, again on October 1, 2005, and once again on October 31, 2006. The lights were captured on video by some witnesses. According to some ufologists, the video evidence suggests that the lights kept the geometrical shape and moved as if they were attached to each other through a dark object. The incident was examined in a Dateline NBC episode on May 18, 2008, and in the episode \"Invasion Illinois\" of the television series UFO Hunters premiered on The History Channel on October 29, 2008.\n\n\n=== 2014 – Kansas and Texas sightings ===\nIn February and March 2014, an aircraft matching the black triangle description was photographed multiple times over Kansas and Texas in daylight. In February 2014, an amateur photographer Jeff Templin snapped pictures of a triangular aircraft while photographing wildlife in Kansas. On Mar 10, 2014, Steve Douglass and Dean Muskett photographed a triangular-shaped aircraft giving off a long contrail over Amarillo, Texas during daylight. Bill Sweetman, Graham Warwick, and Guy Norris of Aviation Week all agree that \"the photos show something real.\"\n\n\n=== 2017 – Southeastern Wisconsin sightings ===\nThe Kenosha UFO wave began in December 2016. The events of 17 February were documented by multiple groups of witnesses. All of the reports consist of a multiple dark triangular objects in the sky with blinking white and red lights, at around 6:30 pm. The craft was also seen on 19 January 2017 at around 5:00 am barely hovering above the ground. The object was described as dark on the bottom with lights and silvery on top. Other sightings include 28 December 2016 at around 8:00 pm and 24 January 2017 at around 9:00 pm.\n\n\n=== 2018 — Lothian, Maryland sightings ===\nTwo witnesses report seeing a slow moving triangular craft with blinking white and red lights at about 11:00 PM June 27, 2018. The craft seemed to be flying low to the ground, almost skimming the tops of trees.\n\n\n== TR-3A Black Manta ==\nThe TR-3A Black Manta is the name of a surveillance aircraft of the United States Air Force, speculated to be developed under a black project. The only evidence for such an aircraft is based on several reported sightings of mysterious flying triangle aircraft over Antelope Valley, an area of desert in southern California. This stretch of desert draws people interested in potential \"black project\"-related aircraft, because it is close to several known military research and testing areas, such as Edwards Air Force Base in California, and United States Air Force Plant 42.\n\n\n=== Rumors ===\nThe TR-3A was said to be a subsonic stealth spy plane with a flying wing design. It was alleged to have been used in the Gulf War to provide laser designation for Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk bombers, for targeting to use with laser-guided bombs. The TR-3 was claimed to have been manufactured by Northrop.Edgar Fouché claimed in 1999 in a BBC documentary he was former Area 51 employee, able to describe another more exotic tactical reconnaissance aircraft called the TR-3B Astra, a successor or cover for the TR-3A built by Lockheed Martin Skunk Works, which would also be a spaceplane of a new kind using a top-secret gravitational shielding engine called the magnetic field disruptor (MFD). Besides being an unconfirmed claim, the physical description of the MFD engine is often said to be pseudoscientific and \"impossible\".How the TR-3 designation came up in publications is unclear. It is clearly not a continuation of the R-for-Reconnaissance series, since ER-2 (NASA designation for U-2 aircraft modified for Earth science studies) stood for \"Earth Resources\", not \"Electronic Reconnaissance\". It is, therefore possible that TR-3 is merely a corruption of Tier III, a name given to a cancelled large reconnaissance unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) flying wing designed around the time of alleged sightings of the Black Manta, circa 1988–1990. The Tier III Minus program that resulted in the unsuccessful Lockheed Martin RQ-3 DarkStar was a scaled-down derivative of the original Tier III.\nTR prefix would also be fitting for Tactical Reconnaissance as opposed to Strategic Reconnaissance (SR) as in the SR-72.\n\n\n=== Potential candidates for TR-3 ===\nBecause there is little evidence to support TR-3\'s existence, only sightings and \"experience\" stories by real people and also the web discussions on it, it is possible that the mysterious flying wing sightings associated with Black Manta could be a technology demonstrator for a potential new-generation tactical reconnaissance aircraft. This contention is supported by United States Air Force (USAF) sources in the late 1980s confirming that the United States had no short-term plans to develop a low-observable U-2 successor.Another candidate for the alleged spy plane is a design from Teledyne Ryan, patented in the United States on April 26, 1977, under number 4,019,699.  This aircraft of low observability, as it is called, was invented by Robert W. Wintersdorff and George R. Cota, employees at Teledyne Ryan, a firm specialized in building unmanned reconnaissance aircraft. On May 10, 1977, a design of an aircraft was patented by Teledyne Ryan under number Des. 244,265, and closely resembles the earlier mentioned example. This design was made by Waldo Virgil Opfer. The first design is unmanned, the second one manned. Whether one of these designs is related to the above-mentioned TR-3 is not positively identified, but it is a coincidence that TR also stands for Teledyne Ryan. Teledyne Ryan was acquired by Northrop Grumman in 1999.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\"TR-3A Evolved From Classified Prototypes, Based on Tactical Penetrator Concept\" Aviation Week & Space Technology, June 10, 1991. p 20-21\n“Triangular Recon Aircraft May be Supporting F-117A” AW&ST, June 10, 1991. p 20.

(101, 'Varginha UFO incident', 'Varginha UFO incident is the name given to a series of events involving the alleged sighting and capture by the military of an extraterrestrial being in Varginha, Brazil, in 1996. Such reports were first broadcast on the Sunday TV show Fantástico of Rede Globo, and gathered media coverage worldwide, including an article in The Wall Street Journal. It has since become a well-known case in modern Brazilian ufology.\nThe Brazilian government has officially denied any claims of being involved in the capture of extraterrestrial biological entities (EBEs), but some theorists claim otherwise, accusing the government of a cover-up. For some the lack of reliable sources is evidence against its actuality; the testimony of unnamed, anonymous \"official\" individuals are frequently featured.\nUFO investigator Kevin D. Randle writes that \"this case is as complicated as any other in the UFO field.\"  Randle notes that there is a lack of physical evidence supporting the case, and adds, \"In fact, we have been unable to verify much of anything.\"Dr. Roger Leir of Ventura, California visited Varginha shortly after the incident. After extensive interviews with local witnesses, he surmised that there were two creatures. One had been injured. They were taken to a local medical clinic. The doctors and nurses of this clinic reported to Dr. Leir a series of highly unusual occurrences, some paranormal in nature. They also described the creatures in medical detail. Dr. Leir was particularly interested in their feet, as he is a podiatrist. When the treatment was completed, the creatures were removed by military personnel. Dr. Leir published a book on his visit, entitled \"UFO Crash in Brazil\",  (ISBN-13: 978-1585091058).\n\n\n== Overview ==\n\n\n=== The creatures ===\nAccording to media reports, the creature was first sighted by three women ranging from 14 to 22 years old: sisters Liliane and Valquíria Fátima Silva, and their friend Kátia Andrade Xavier. They allegedly saw the creature in the afternoon of January 20, 1996:  A biped about 1.6 metres (5 ft), with a large head and very thin body, with V-shaped feet, brown skin, and large red eyes. It seemed to be wobbly or unsteady, and the girls assumed it was injured or sick.\nThe Silva sisters said they fled and told mother they had seen the \"devil\". The woman did not believe them up until she went to the area where they had allegedly seen the creature, and smelled a strong ammonia-like odor, and found nothing but its footsteps and a dog sniffing the place. After relating their tale to family and friends, rumors began to spread throughout the city regarding UFO sightings and alien creatures being abducted by the military forces. Two days later, another creature was allegedly found lying along a road. Three military trucks were supposedly sent to retrieve it.\nA similar creature was reportedly seen at the local zoo by its janitor. The following months, three animals mysteriously died.\n\n\n=== UFO sightings ===\nOralina and Eurico de Freitas, owners of a farm in the town, reportedly saw a UFO hovering over their cattle. Oralina was attracted by the sudden agitation in her animals and spotted the flying object after she went to check what was disturbing them. The object supposedly hovered over their field for 40 minutes.\n\n\n== Inquiry ==\nIn regards to the wasteland creature, an official inquiry led by the Brazilian military authorities concluded in 2010 that the Silva sisters had actually came across a homeless, mentally unstable man nicknamed \"Mudinho\" covered in mud, and that the military trucks were operating in their normal schedule that night.

(102, 'Kelly–Hopkinsville encounter', 'The Kelly–Hopkinsville encounter (a.k.a. Hopkinsville Goblins Case, Kelly Green Men Case) was a claimed close encounter with extraterrestrial beings in 1955 near Kelly and Hopkinsville in Christian County, Kentucky, United States. UFOlogists regard it as one of the most significant and well-documented cases in the history of UFO incidents, while skeptics say the reports were due to \"the effects of excitement\" and misidentification of natural phenomena such as meteors and owls. Psychologists have used the alleged incident as an academic example of pseudoscience to help students distinguish truth from fiction.\n\n\n== Claims ==\n\nOn the evening of August 21, 1955, five adults and seven children arrived at the Hopkinsville police station claiming that small alien creatures from a spaceship were attacking their farmhouse and they had been holding them off with gunfire \"for nearly four hours\". Two of the adults, Elmer Sutton and Billy Ray Taylor, claimed they had been shooting at \"twelve to fifteen\" short, dark figures who repeatedly popped up at the doorway or peered into the windows.Concerned about a possible gun battle between local citizens, four city police, five state troopers, three deputy sheriffs, and four military police from the nearby US Army Fort Campbell drove to the Sutton farmhouse located near the town of Kelly in Christian County. Their search yielded nothing apart from evidence of gunfire and holes in window and door screens made by firearms.Residents of the farmhouse included Glennie Lankford, her children, Lonnie, Charlton, and Mary, two sons from a previous marriage, Elmer \"Lucky\" Sutton, John Charley \"J.C.\" Sutton, and their respective wives, Vera and Alene, Alene\'s brother O.P. Baker, and Billy Ray Taylor and his wife June. Both the Taylors, \"Lucky\" and Vera Sutton were reportedly itinerant carnival workers that were visiting the farmhouse. The next day, neighbors told two officers that the families had \"packed up and left\" after claiming \"the creatures had returned about 3:30 in the morning\".\n\n\n== Press coverage ==\nThe family\'s claims received widespread coverage in local and national press. Early articles did not refer to \"little green men\", the color was later added to some newspaper stories. Estimates of the size of the alleged creatures varied from two feet to four feet, and details such as \"large pointed ears, clawlike hands, eyes that glowed yellow and spindly legs\" later appeared in various media.\n\n\n== Explanations ==\nPsychologists Rodney Schmaltz and Scott Lilienfeld cite the alleged incident as an example of pseudoscience and an \"extraordinary claim\" to help students develop critical thinking skills.\nIt is plausible, if not likely, that the \'aliens\' were Great Horned Owls, and there is some evidence that the eyewitnesses may have been intoxicated during the \'alien attack\' (Nickell, 2006).\n\nCommittee for Skeptical Inquiry member and skeptic Joe Nickell notes that the family could have misidentified \"eagle owls\" or great horned owls, which are nocturnal, fly silently, have yellow eyes, and aggressively defend their nests. According to Nickell, meteor sightings also occurred at the time that could explain Billy Ray Taylor\'s claim that he saw \"a bright light streak across the sky and disappear beyond a tree line some distance from the house\".According to author Brian Dunning, \"there are simply too many similarities between the creatures reported by the families and an aggressive pair of the local Great Horned Owls, which do stand about two-thirds of a meter tall\".\n\n\n== UFOlogists ==\nFrench ufologist Renaud Leclet also argued in a publication that the explanation of the case is great horned owls.UFOlogist Jerome Clark writes that the supposed creatures \"floated\" through the trees and the sound of bullets striking them \"resembled bullets striking a metal bucket\". Clark describes \"an odd luminous patch along a fence where one of the beings had been shot, and, in the woods beyond, a green light whose source could not be determined\", however this description was consistent with foxfire, a bioluminescent fungus on decaying wood.Clark also wrote that investigations by \"police, Air Force officers from nearby Fort Campbell, and civilian ufologists found no evidence of a hoax\", however Brian Dunning reports that \"the claim that Air Force investigators showed up the next day at Mrs. Lankford\'s house has been published a number of times by later authors, but I could find no corroborating evidence of this.\" Dunning also observes that \"the four military police who accompanied the police officers on the night of the event were from an Army base, not an Air Force base.\"Some UFOlogists compared the alleged creatures to gremlins, which have since often been referred to as the \"Hopkinsville Goblins\" in popular culture. UFOlogist Allan Hendry wrote \"[t]his case is distinguished by its duration and also by the number of witnesses involved.\" Project Blue Book listed the case as a hoax with no further comment.\n\n\n== Popular culture ==\nThe Kelly-Hopkinsville sighting is at the origin of the popularization of the words \"little green men\" (prior to this sighting, flying saucer occupants were called \"little men\"; \"little green men\" were limited to the science-fiction culture, in particular in Mack Reynolds\' The Case for the Little Green Men (1951) and in Fredric Brown\'s Martians Go Home (1955). But the day following the sighting, the local reporters started to call the creatures \"little green men\" and the words were soon reproduced in many newspapers, quoted on the radio, and translated into other languages).The Kelly Community now celebrates the anniversary of the event on the third weekend of every August with an event called the Kelly \"Little Green Men\" Days.\nAccording to the book Comedy-Horror Films: A Chronological History, 1914–2008 by Bruce G. Hallenbeck, the 1986 movie Critters is loosely based on the Kelly-Hopkinsville case.\nThe Pokémon Sableye, introduced in Pokémon Ruby & Sapphire, is based on the goblins described in the Kelly–Hopkinsville encounter. In the games, they are animated with a swaying or \"wading\" motion, based on the creatures\' reported gait.\nIn the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game, the \"hobkins\", a type of gremlin from the Bestiary 5 book, is based upon the goblins described in the encounter.\nThe Kelly–Hopkinsville encounter was the basis for the Annoyance Theater\'s musical \"It Came From Kentucky\" in Chicago.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of UFO sightings\nClose encounter\nNight Skies\n\n\n== Links ==\nJoe Nickel interview about the Kelly–Hopkinsville encounter on the podcast Monster Talk: Episode 137: American Goblins—Part 2..\n\n\n== References ==', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d7/Blue_pog.svg'),

(104, 'Exeter incident', 'The Exeter incident was a highly publicized UFO sighting that occurred on September 3, 1965, approximately 5 miles (8 km) south of Exeter, New Hampshire, in the neighboring town of Kensington. Although several separate sightings had been made by numerous witnesses in the weeks leading up to September 3, the specific incident, eventually to become by far the most famous, involved a local teenager and two police officers. The November/December 2011 edition of Skeptical Inquirer offers an explanation of the incident, based on details reported by the eyewitnesses.\n\n\n== The Muscarello sighting ==\nAt approximately 2 a.m. on September 3, 1965, Norman Muscarello was hitchhiking to his parents\' home in Exeter along NH 150. Muscarello, 18, had recently graduated from high school and was about to leave for service in the United States Navy. He had been visiting his girlfriend at her parents\' home in nearby Amesbury, Massachusetts; since he did not own a car, he would catch a ride to and from his girlfriend\'s home. However, at that time of night there was little traffic on the highway, and as he walked he noticed five flashing red lights in some nearby woods. The lights illuminated the woods and a nearby farmhouse. (The farm belonged to the Dining family, who were not at home at the time.) The lights soon moved towards him, and Muscarello became terrified and dived into a ditch. The lights moved away and hovered near the Dining farmhouse before going back into the woods. Muscarello ran to the farmhouse, pounded on the door and yelled for help, but no one answered. When he saw a car coming down the road, he ran into the road and forced it to stop. The couple in the car drove him to the Exeter police station.\nAt the police station Muscarello told his story to officer Reginald Toland, who worked the night desk. Toland, who knew Muscarello, was impressed by his obvious fear and agitated state. Toland radioed police officer Eugene Bertrand, Jr., who earlier in the evening had passed a distressed woman sitting in her car on NH 108. When Bertrand stopped and asked if she had a problem, the woman told him that a \"huge object with flashing red lights\" had been following her car for 12 miles (19 km) and stopped over her car before flying away. Bertrand considered her a \"kook\", but did stay with her for approximately 15 minutes until she had calmed down and was ready to resume her drive.\nAfter arriving at the police station and hearing Muscarello\'s story, Bertrand decided to drive back to the Dining farm with Muscarello to investigate the field where he had seen the UFO.\n\n\n== Officers Bertrand and Hunt ==\nBertrand drove Muscarello back to the place of his sighting. From Bertrand\'s patrol car they saw nothing unusual. However, when they left the car and walked towards the woods where Muscarello had first seen the objects, some horses in a nearby corral began kicking their stalls and making loud, frightened noises. Dogs in the area also began howling. Bertrand and Muscarello both saw an object rise up from the woods beyond the corral. Bertrand described the UFO as \"this huge, dark object as big as a barn over there, with red flashing lights on it.\" The object moved slowly towards them, swaying back and forth. Instinctively remembering his police training, Bertrand dropped to one knee, drew his pistol, and pointed it at the object. He then decided that shooting would not be wise, so he reholstered the pistol, grabbed Muscarello, and both men ran back to the patrol car. Bertrand radioed another Exeter policeman, David Hunt, for assistance, and while the two men waited for Hunt to arrive they continued to watch the object. According to UFO historian Jerome Clark, Bertrand and Muscarello \"observed the object as it hovered 100 feet away and at 100 feet altitude. It rocked back and forth. The pulsating red lights flashed in rapid sequence, first from right to left, then left to right, each cycle consuming no more than two seconds; the [local] animals continued to act agitated.\" When Hunt arrived, he also watched the strange object. The object finally flew away over the woods and disappeared. Hunt soon saw a B-47 bomber fly overhead, and he later told journalist John G. Fuller that \"You could tell the difference\" between the UFO and the bomber, \"there was no comparison.\" All three men drove back to the Exeter police station and immediately filed separate reports on what they had seen. Bertrand then drove Muscarello home and told his mother what had happened.\n\n\n== Other Exeter sightings ==\nThe sightings by Muscarello and the two policemen received national publicity. John G. Fuller, a journalist and regular columnist for Saturday Review magazine, decided to travel to Exeter and investigate. Fuller interviewed a number of people in the Exeter area who also claimed to have witnessed strange lights and unusual objects. Among them were Ron Smith, a senior at Exeter High School, who told Fuller that about two or three weeks after Muscarello\'s sighting, he was riding with his mother and aunt one evening at 11:30. According to Smith, he, his mother and aunt all saw an object with \"a red light on top and the bottom was white and glowed. It appeared to be spinning. It passed over the car once and when it passed over and got in front, it stopped in midair. Then it went back over the car again.\" Fuller also spoke to police officer Toland at Exeter\'s police station. Toland told Fuller of a number of calls he had received from Exeter-area residents regarding UFO sightings. A good example of the type of calls Toland had received came from Mrs. Ralph Lindsay. According to Toland \"she called in here early, just before dawn. She said it was right out her window as she was calling. It was like a big orange ball, almost as big as the harvest Moon ... and it wasn\'t the Moon, either ... all the time she was talking to me, her kids were at the window watching it. Now why would people go to all this trouble — people all over the area — if they weren\'t seeing something real?\"\n\n\n== Air Force investigation and explanation ==\nWhen Exeter\'s police chief read the reports of Bertrand, Hunt, and Muscarello he called nearby Pease Air Force Base and reported a UFO sighting. The Air Force sent Major David Griffin and Lieutenant Alan Brandt to interview the three men. The Air Force officers asked all three men to not report their sighting to the press, but since a reporter from the Manchester Union-Leader newspaper had already interviewed them, it was too late. Major Griffin sent a report of the incident to the staff of Project Blue Book, the official Air Force research group assigned to study UFO reports. Griffin wrote that \"At this time I have been unable to arrive at a probable cause of this sighting. The three observers seem to be stable, reliable persons, especially the two patrolmen. I viewed the area of the sighting and found nothing in the area that could be the probable cause. Pease AFB had five B-47 aircraft flying in the area but I do not believe that they had any connection with this sighting.\"However, before Project Blue Book could send this evaluation to the Pentagon, the Air Force had already issued an explanation of Muscarello and the two policemen\'s sighting to the press. The Pentagon informed reporters that the three men had seen \"nothing more than stars and planets twinkling ... owing to a temperature inversion.\" Project Blue Book then issued its own explanation, stating that \"Operation Big Blast ... a SAC/NORAD training mission\" had been active on the night of the sighting and that it could have accounted for the UFO. Project Blue Book\'s supervisor, USAF Major Hector Quintanilla, wrote policemen Bertrand and Hunt that \"in addition to aircraft from this operation [Big Blast], there were also five B-47 aircraft flying in your area during this period ... since there were many aircraft in the area, at the time, and there were no reports of unidentified objects from personnel engaged in this operation, we might then assume that the objects [you] observed between midnight and two a.m. might be associated with this military air operation.\" However, Quintanilla also added that \"If, however, these aircraft were noted by either of you, this would tend to eliminate this air operation as a possible explanation for the objects observed.\"\n\n\n== Controversy and Air Force retraction ==\nMuscarello, Bertrand, and Hunt all strongly disagreed with the Air Force explanation. The two policemen sent a letter to Project Blue Book in which they stated, \"As you can imagine, we have been the subject of considerable ridicule since the Pentagon released its \'final evaluation\' of our sighting of September 3, 1965. In other words, both Patrolman Hunt and myself saw this object at close range, checked it out with each other, confirmed and reconfirmed that it was not any type of conventional aircraft ... and went to considerable trouble to confirm that the weather was clear, there was no wind, no chance of weather inversion, and that what we were seeing was in no way a military or civilian aircraft.\" Bertrand also noted that their UFO sighting took place nearly an hour after Operation Big Blast was said to have ended, which eliminated the operation as a possible cause of the sighting. When Project Blue Book did not respond to their letter, on December 29, 1965 — nearly four months after the sighting — the two men sent another letter to Blue Book in which they wrote that the object they observed \"was absolutely silent with no rush of air from jets or chopper blades whatsoever. And it did not have any wings or tail ... it lit up the entire field, and two nearby houses turned completely red.\"In addition to Muscarello and the policemen, John G. Fuller also ridiculed the Air Force explanation in print. He wrote that he had observed an unusual object near Exeter himself, and that it was being chased by an Air Force jet fighter. Raymond Fowler, the New England investigator for the National Investigations Committee On Aerial Phenomena (NICAP), also filed a detailed report on the Exeter sightings. In his view the Air Force explanation was also incorrect. At one point an Air Force officer claimed that the UFOs people had been observing were merely lights from nearby Pease AFB. To prove it, he had the lights activated before a large crowd who were gathered some distance away. According to Fowler, \"he ordered personnel at the base to turn the lights on. Everybody looked and waited — and nothing happened. Frustrated, he yelled into the mike to turn on the lights. A voice replied that the lights were on. The very embarrassed officer slunk back into the seat of the staff car and drove off amongst the laughs and jeers of the crowd.\"In January 1966 Lieutenant Colonel John Spaulding, from the Office of the Secretary of the Air Force, finally replied to the policemen\'s two letters. Spaulding wrote that \"based on additional information submitted to our UFO investigation officer, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio, we have been unable to identify the object you observed on September 3, 1965.\"\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nThe Exeter UFO sightings — and particularly the incident involving Norman Muscarello and police officers Eugene Bertrand and David Hunt — remain among the best-documented and best-publicized in UFO history. In 1966 Fuller published an account of his investigation into the case. Entitled Incident at Exeter, it made The New York Times bestseller list. Norman Muscarello died after a brief illness in April 2003; he insisted to his death that what he had witnessed was real and not an ordinary object. Of the other alleged witnesses, Bertrand died in 1998, and Hunt in 2011. In 2010, the Exeter Kiwanis Club started the \"Exeter UFO Festival\" as a fundraiser to benefit children\'s charities in the Exeter area.\n\n\n== Skeptical Inquirer explanation ==\nIn 2011, Joe Nickell, a prominent skeptic, and James McGaha, Major, USAF retired, proposed a possible explanation for the incident in the Skeptical Inquirer. As a pilot, McGaha had been refueled in flight by KC-97 tanker aircraft like the ones stationed at Pease AFB near Exeter in 1965. In the article, he claimed to have recognized the flashing red light pattern reported by the witnesses Bertrand and Muscarello: one, two, three, four, five, four, three, two, one. According to Nickell and McGaha, before refueling, the underbelly of the KC-97 tankers flashed five very bright red lights in that same pattern. The refueling boom hung down at a 60 degree angle and would flutter in the air currents when not being controlled by the boom operator: hence \"floating like a leaf\" per witness Muscarello.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of reported UFO sightings\nUnidentified flying object\n\n\n== Footnotes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nClark, Jerome.

(105, 'Stephenville, Texas UFO sightings', 'Stephenville is a city in and the county seat of Erath County, Texas, United States. The population was 20,797 in 2017 according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Founded in 1856, it is home to Tarleton State University. Stephenville is among several communities that call themselves the \"Cowboy Capital of the World\".\n\n\n== History ==\n\nStephenville is named after John M. Stephen, who settled there in 1854, and donated the land for the townsite laid out by George B. Erath when the county was organized in 1856. In the first two years of its settlement, the townsite was successful; by 1858, the population reached 776. However, the townsite was located in Comanche territory and raids were common. Also, the hardships of the American Civil War forced citizens to leave. The population declined until 1871, when it grew after Stephenville became an agriculture and livestock center. Coal mining also became important to the area in 1886, and was a major segment of the economy for the following three decades.\nStephenville was incorporated in 1889, with the arrival of the Fort Worth and Rio Grande Railway. In the 1890s, many of the buildings around the town square were built, Tarleton State University opened, and the community\'s two newspapers merged to become the Empire-Tribune, which is still in existence. In February 1907, the Stephenville North and South Texas Railway was chartered by Stephenville and Hamilton business interests which later sold the line in 1910 to the historic St. Louis Southwestern Railway of Texas system. In the 20th century, industry became an important part of Stephenville, and the population has steadily increased since the 1920s.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nStephenville is located at 32°13′13″N 98°12′49″W (32.220168, −98.213630).According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 11.89 square miles (30.8 km2), of which 11.89 square miles (30.8 km2) are land and 0.04 square miles (0.10 km2) is covered by water.\nStephenville is served by three major US highways - US Highway 377, US Highway 281, and US Highway 67 (which joins into US Hwy 377).\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild to cool winters.

Several residents described a craft as the size of a football field, while others said they were nearly a mile long, similar to the Phoenix lights mass sightings of March 13, 1997. Some observers reported military aircraft pursuing the objects.CNN\'s Larry King covered the news story in the days following the incident, and according to Steve Allen, a private pilot who witnessed the UFO, the object was travelling at high speed which supposedly reached 3,000 feet in the air. Allen said it was \"About a half a mile wide and about a mile long. It was humongous, whatever it was.\"The History Channel show UFO Hunters featured a story about the UFO sightings.\nOn January 23, after initially denying that any aircraft were operating in the area, the US Air Force said that it was conducting training flights in the Stephenville area that involved 10 fighter jets. The Air Force said they were merely F-16 Fighting Falcon jets conducting night flights from NAS JRB Fort Worth.\nWashington Post blogger Emil Steiner reported that conspiracy theories had arisen claiming that reporter Angelia Joiner was fired from her job at the Empire-Tribune due to her reporting of the UFO story. Steiner added, \"conjecture breeds conspiracy theories. Any official denial can be labeled a cover-up\".

(110, 'Flying saucer', 'A flying saucer (also referred to as \"a flying disc\") is a descriptive term for a supposed type of flying craft having a disc or saucer-shaped body, commonly used generically to refer to an anomalous flying object. The term was coined in 1930 but has generally been supplanted since 1952 by the United States Air Force term unidentified flying objects or UFOs. Early reported sightings of unknown \"flying saucers\" usually described them as silver or metallic, sometimes reported as covered with navigation lights or surrounded with a glowing light, hovering or moving rapidly, either alone or in tight formations with other similar craft, and exhibiting high maneuverability.\nWhile disc-shaped flying objects have been interpreted as being sporadically recorded since the Middle Ages, the first recorded use of the term \"flying saucer\" for an unidentified flying object was to describe a probable meteor that fell over Texas and Oklahoma on June 17, 1930. \"Some who saw the weird light described it as a huge comet, a flaming flying saucer, a great red glow, a ball of fire.\" The term \"flying saucer\" had been in use since 1890 to describe a clay pigeon shooting target, which resembles a classic UFO shape.\nThe highly publicized sighting by Kenneth Arnold on June 24, 1947, resulted in the popularity of the term \"flying saucer\" by U.S. newspapers. Although Arnold never specifically used the term \"flying saucer\", he was quoted at the time saying the shape of the objects he saw was like a \"saucer\", \"disc\", or \"pie-plate\", and several years later added he had also said \"the objects moved like saucers skipping across the water.\" Both the terms flying saucer and flying disc were used commonly and interchangeably in the media until the early 1950s.\nArnold\'s sighting was followed by thousands of similar sightings across the world. Such sightings were once very common, to such an extent that \"flying saucer\" was a synonym for UFO through the 1960s before it began to fall out of favor. A lot of sightings of the cigar-shaped UFO were reported following it. More recently, the flying saucer has been largely supplanted by other alleged UFO-related vehicles, such as the black triangle. In fact, the term UFO was invented in 1952, to try to reflect the wider diversity of shapes being seen. However, unknown saucer-like objects are still reported, such as in the widely publicized 2006 sighting over Chicago-O\'Hare airport.\nMany of the alleged flying saucer photographs of the era are now believed to be hoaxes. The flying saucer is now considered largely an icon of the 1950s and of B movies in particular, and is a popular subject in comic science fiction.Beyond the common usage of the phrase, there have also been man-made saucer-like craft. The first flying disc craft was called the Discopter and was patented by Alexander Weygers in 1944. Other designs have followed, such as the American Vought V-173 / XF5U \"Flying Flapjack\", the British GFS Projects flying saucer, or the British \"S.A.U.C.E.R.\" (\"Saucer Aircraft Utilising Coanda Effect Reactions\") flying saucer, by inventor Alf Beharie.\n\n\n== Sightings ==\n\nA manuscript illustration of the 10th-century Japanese narrative, The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter, depicts a round flying machine similar to a flying saucer.A record of a saucer-shaped object is from 1290 of a silver disc flying over a village in Yorkshire. Disc-like flying objects were occasionally reported throughout the millennium. For example, in a mass sighting over Nuremberg in 1561, discs and spheres were reported emerging from large cylinders (see woodcut at left). They are also claimed by ufologists to frequently show up in religious artwork.Another well-documented specific comparison of the objects to saucers was the Kenneth Arnold sighting on June 24, 1947, while Arnold was flying near Mount Rainier. He reported seeing 9 brightly reflecting vehicles, one shaped like a crescent but the others more disc- or saucer-shaped, flying in an echelon formation, weaving like the tail of a kite, flipping and flashing in the sun, and traveling with a speed of at least 1,200 miles per hour (1,900 km/h). In addition to the saucer or disc shape (Arnold also used the terms \"pie plate\" and half-moon shaped), he also later said he described the motion of the craft as \"like a saucer if you skip it across water\", leading to the term \"flying saucer\" and also \"flying disc\" (which were synonymous for a number of years).\nImmediately following the report, hundreds of sightings of usually saucer-like objects were reported across the United States and also in some other countries. The most widely publicized of these was the sighting by a United Airlines crew on July 4 of nine more disc-like objects pacing their plane over Idaho, not far from Arnold\'s initial sighting.  On July 8, the Army Air Force base at Roswell, New Mexico issued a press release saying that they had recovered a \"flying disc\" from a nearby ranch, the so-called Roswell UFO incident, which was front-page news until the military issued a retraction saying that it was a weather balloon.\nOn July 9, the Army Air Force Directorate of Intelligence, assisted by the FBI, began a secret study of the best of the flying saucer reports, including Arnold\'s and the United Airlines\' crew. Three weeks later they issued an intelligence estimate describing the typical characteristics reported (including that they were often reported as disc-like and metallic) and concluded that something was really flying around. A follow-up investigation by the Air Materiel Command at Wright Field, Ohio arrived at the same conclusion. A widespread official government study of the saucers was urged by General Nathan Twining. This led to the formation of Project Sign (also known as Project Saucer) at the end of 1947, the first public Air Force UFO study. This evolved into Project Grudge (1949–1951) and then Project Blue Book (1952–1970).\nThe term \"flying saucer\" quickly became deeply ingrained in the English vernacular. A Gallup poll from August 1947 found that 90% had heard about the mysterious flying saucers or flying discs, and a 1950 Gallup poll found that 94% of those polled had heard the term, easily beating out all other mentioned commonly used terms in the news such as \"Cold War\", \"universal military training\", and \"bookie\".\nAir Force statistics indicated that the basic saucer-shape continued to be the most commonly reported one through the 1950s and 1960s until Project Blue Book ended in 1970. There have been some claims, still undocumented by scientific study, that reports of saucers began to decline in the 1970s, being supplanted by other craft such as black triangles, cylinders, and amorphous shapes. It has also been asserted that despite the increase in portable cameras, photographs dwindled as Cold War and Space Race interest decreased and a number of notable images were exposed as fakes.\n\n\n== Explanations ==\n\nIn addition to the extraterrestrial hypothesis, a variety of possible explanations for flying saucers have been put forward. One of the most common states that most photos of saucers were hoaxes; cylindrical metal objects such as pie tins, hubcaps and dustbin lids were easy to obtain, and the poor focus seen in UFO images makes the true scale of the object difficult to ascertain. However, some photos and movies were deemed authentic after intensive study. An example was the saucer-like object photographed by farmer Paul Trent near Portland, Oregon in 1950, which passed all tests when studied by the Condon Committee in the 1960s.Another theory states that most are natural phenomena such as lenticular clouds and balloons, which appear disc-like in some lighting conditions.A third theory puts all saucer sightings down to a form of mass hysteria. Arnold described the craft he saw as saucer-like but not perfectly round (he described them as thin, flat, rounded in front but chopped in back and coming to a point), but the image of the circular saucer was fixed in the public consciousness. The theory posits that as the use of the term flying saucer in popular culture decreased, so too did sightings.\n\nLong before the Kenneth Arnold sighting of 1947 and the adoption of the term \"flying saucer\" by the public, depictions of streamlined saucer-shaped aircraft or spacecraft had appeared in the popular press, dating back to at least 1911. In particular, commentators like Milton Rothman have noted the appearance of the \"flying saucers\" concept in the fantasy artwork of the 1930s pulp science fiction magazines, by artists like Frank R. Paul. Frank Wu, a notable contemporary science fiction illustrator, has written:\nThe point is that the idea of space vehicles shaped like flying saucers was imprinted in the national psyche for many years prior to 1947, when the Roswell incident took place. It didn\'t take much stretching for the first observers of UFOs to assume that the unknown objects hovering in the sky had the same disk shape as the science fictional vehicles.\nA scientific and statistical analysis of 3200 Air Force UFO cases by the Battelle Memorial Institute from 1952 to 1954 found that most were indeed due to natural phenomena, about 2% were due to hoaxes or psychological effects and only 0.4% were thought due to clouds. Other very minor contributors were birds, light phenomena such as mirages or searchlights, and various miscellany such as flares or kites. The vast majority of identified objects (about 84%) were explained as balloons, aircraft, or astronomical objects. However, about 22% of all sightings still defied any plausible explanation by the team of scientists, and percentage of unidentifieds rose to 33% for the best witnesses and cases. Thus when carefully studied, a substantial fraction of reports (given the available data) is currently not understood.\n\n\n=== Fata Morgana (mirages) and flying saucers ===\n\nFata Morgana, a type of mirage, may be responsible for some flying saucers sightings, by displaying objects located below the astronomical horizon hovering in the sky, and magnifying and distorting them.\nSimilarly some unidentifieds seen on radar might also be due to Fata Morgana-type atmospheric phenomena, though more technically known as \"anomalous propagation\" and more commonly as \"radar ghosts\". Official UFO investigations in France suggest:\n\nAs is well known, atmospheric ducting is the explanation for certain optical mirages, and in particular the arctic illusion called \"fata morgana\" where distant ocean or surface ice, which is essentially flat, appears to the viewer in the form of vertical columns and spires, or \"castles in the air.\" People often assume that mirages occur only rarely. This may be true of optical mirages, but conditions for radar mirages are more common, due to the role played by water vapor which strongly affects the atmospheric refractivity in relation to radio waves. Since clouds are closely associated with high levels of water vapor, optical mirages due to water vapor are often rendered undetectable by the accompanying opaque cloud. On the other hand, radar propagation is essentially unaffected by the water droplets of the cloud so that changes in water vapor content with altitude are very effective in producing atmospheric ducting and radar mirages.\n\nFata Morgana was named as a hypothesis for the mysterious Australian phenomenon Min Min light.\n\n\n== Manmade flying saucer aircraft ==\n\nThe first documented patent for a lenticular flying machine was submitted by Romanian inventor Henri Coanda. He made a functional small scale model which was flown in 1932 and a patent was granted in 1935. In 1967, Coanda told a symposium organized by the Romanian Academy:\n\n\"These airplanes we have today are no more than a perfection of a toy made of paper children use to play with. My opinion is we should search for a completely different flying machine, based on other flying principles. I consider the aircraft of the future, that which will take off vertically, fly as usual and land vertically. This flying machine should have no parts in movement. The idea came from the huge power of the cyclons\" \nOther attempts have been made, with limited success, to produce manned vehicles based on the flying saucer design. While some, such as the Avrocar and M200G Volantor have been produced in limited numbers, most fail to leave the drawing board. The Avrocar, with vertical takeoff and landing, was originally intended to replace both the Jeep and the helicopter in combat situations, but proved to be inadequate for both. In spite of a powerful turbojet, it could not rise more than four or five feet off the ground, i.e., out of ground effect. Thus, the Avrocar could be seen as a prototype for the early generations of hovercraft, lacking only a \'skirt\' to make it a truly effective example of the type. Unmanned saucers have had more success; the Sikorsky Cypher is a saucer-like UAV which uses the disc-shaped shroud to protect rotor blades.\nSome more advanced flying saucers capable of spaceflight have been proposed, often as black projects by aeronautics companies. The Lenticular Reentry Vehicle was a secret project run by Convair for a saucer device which could carry both astronauts and nuclear weapons into orbit; the nuclear-powered system was planned in depth, but is not believed to have ever flown. More exotically, British Rail worked on plans for the British Rail \"Space Vehicle\" a proposed, saucer-shaped craft based on so far undiscovered technologies such as nuclear fusion and superconductivity, which was supposed to have been able to transport multiple passenger between planets, but never went beyond the patent stage.There is at least one design that received a US patent in 2005: U.S. Patent 6,960,975 It claims to be \"propelled by the pressure of inflationary vacuum state\".\nAdditionally, a professor at the University of Florida has begun work on a Wingless Electromagnetic Air Vehicle (WEAV) for NASA which has received public interest because of its coincidental resemblance to a flying saucer.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\n\nAfter 1947, the flying saucer quickly became a stereotypical symbol of both extraterrestrials and science fiction, and features in many films of mid-20th century science fiction, including The Atomic Submarine (1959), The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951), Plan 9 from Outer Space (1959), Earth vs. the Flying Saucers (1956), as well as the television series The Invaders. As the flying saucer was surpassed by other designs and concepts, it fell out of favor with straight science-fiction moviemakers, but continued to be used ironically in comedy movies, especially in reference to the low-budget B movies which often featured saucer-shaped alien craft.\nHowever, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer gave its high production value film Forbidden Planet (1956) a flying saucer called the United Planets Cruiser C-57D, presenting a plausible human exploration, faster-than-light starship of the 23rd century. In the television series Lost in Space (1965-1968), the Robinson family had a disc-shaped spaceship. Saucers appeared in the television series Babylon 5 (1994-1998) as the standard ship design used by a race called the Vree. Aliens in the film Independence Day (1996) attacked humanity in giant city-sized saucer-shaped spaceships.\nThe sleek, silver flying saucer in particular is seen as a symbol of 1950s culture; the motif is common in Googie architecture and in Atomic Age décor. The image is often invoked retrofuturistically to produce a nostalgic feel in period works, especially in comic science fiction; both Mars Attacks! (1996) and Destroy All Humans! draw on the flying saucer as part of the larger satire of 1950s B movie tropes.\nThe Twilight Zone episodes \"The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street\", \"Third from the Sun\", \"Death Ship\", \"To Serve Man\", \"The Invaders\" and \"On Thursday We Leave for Home\" all make use of the iconic saucer from Forbidden Planet.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nAdamski, George (1953).

(111, '1952 Washington D.C. UFO incident', 'The 1952 Washington, D.C. UFO incident, also known as the Washington flap, the Washington National Airport Sightings, or the Invasion of Washington, was a series of unidentified flying object reports from July 12 to July 29, 1952, over Washington, D.C. The most publicized sightings took place on consecutive weekends, July 19–20 and July 26–27. UFO historian Curtis Peebles called the incident \"the climax of the 1952 (UFO) flap\" - \"Never before or after did Project Blue Book and the Air Force undergo such a tidal wave of (UFO) reports.\"\n\n\n== Events of July 19–20 ==\nAt 11:40 p.m. on Saturday, July 19, 1952, Edward Nugent, an air traffic controller at Washington National Airport (today Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport), spotted seven objects on his radar. The objects were located 15 miles (24 km) south-southwest of the city; no known aircraft were in the area and the objects were not following any established flight paths. Nugent\'s superior, Harry Barnes, a senior air-traffic controller at the airport, watched the objects on Nugent\'s radarscope. He later wrote:\n\nWe knew immediately that a very strange situation existed . . . their movements were completely radical compared to those of ordinary aircraft.Barnes had two controllers check Nugent\'s radar; they found that it was working normally. Barnes then called National Airport\'s radar-equipped control tower; the controllers there, Howard Cocklin and Joe Zacko, said that they also had unidentified blips on their radar screen, and that they had seen \"a bright light hovering in the sky...[it] took off, zooming away at incredible speed.\" Cocklin told Zacko \"Did you see that? What the hell was that?\"At this point, other objects appeared in all sectors of the radarscope; when they moved over the White House and the United States Capitol, Barnes called Andrews Air Force Base, located 10 miles from National Airport. Although Andrews reported that they had no unusual objects on their radar, an airman  soon called the base\'s control tower to report the sighting of a strange object. Airman William Brady, who was in the tower, then saw an \"object which appeared to be like an orange ball of fire, trailing a tail . . . [it was] unlike anything I had ever seen before.\" As Brady tried to alert the other personnel in the tower, the strange object \"took off at an unbelievable speed.\" On one of National Airport\'s runways, S.C. Pierman, a Capital Airlines pilot, was waiting in the cockpit of his DC-4 for permission to take off. After spotting what he believed to be a meteor, he was told that the control tower\'s radar had detected unknown objects closing in on his position. Pierman observed six objects — \"white, tailless, fast-moving lights\" — over a 14-minute period. Pierman was in radio contact with Barnes during his sighting, and Barnes later related that \"each sighting coincided with a pip we could see near his plane. When he reported that the light streaked off at a high speed, it disappeared on our scope.\"At Andrews Air Force Base, meanwhile, the control tower personnel were tracking on radar what some thought to be unknown objects, but others suspected, and in one instance were able to prove, were simply stars and meteors. However, Staff Sgt. Charles Davenport observed an orange-red light to the south; the light \"would appear to stand still, then make an abrupt change in direction and altitude . . . this happened several times.\" At one point both radar centers at National Airport and the radar at Andrews Air Force Base were tracking an object hovering over a radio beacon. The object vanished in all three radar centers at the same time. At 3 a.m., shortly before two United States Air Force F-94 Starfire jet fighters from New Castle Air Force Base in Delaware arrived over Washington, all of the objects vanished from the radar at National Airport. However, when the jets ran low on fuel and left, the objects returned, which convinced Barnes that \"the UFOs were monitoring radio traffic and behaving accordingly.\"  The objects were last detected by radar at 5:30 a.m.\n\n\n== Publicity and Air Force reaction ==\nThe sightings of July 19–20, 1952, made front-page headlines in newspapers around the nation. A typical example was the headline from the Cedar Rapids Gazette in Iowa. It read \"SAUCERS SWARM OVER CAPITAL\" in large black type. By coincidence, USAF Captain Edward J. Ruppelt, the supervisor of the Air Force\'s Project Blue Book investigation into UFO sightings, was in Washington at the time. However, he did not learn about the sightings until Monday, July 21, when he read the headlines in a Washington-area newspaper. After talking with intelligence officers at the Pentagon about the sightings, Ruppelt spent several hours trying to obtain a staff car so he could travel around Washington to investigate the sightings, but was refused as only generals and senior colonels could use staff cars. He was told that he could rent a taxicab with his own money; by this point Ruppelt was so frustrated that he left Washington and flew back to Blue Book\'s headquarters at Wright-Patterson AFB in Dayton, Ohio. Upon returning to Dayton, Ruppelt spoke with an Air Force radar specialist, Captain Roy James, who felt that unusual weather conditions could have caused the unknown radar targets.\n\n\n== Events of July 26–27 ==\nAt 8:15 p.m. on Saturday, July 26, 1952, a pilot and stewardess on a National Airlines flight into Washington observed some strange lights above their plane. Within minutes, both radar centers at National Airport, and the radar at Andrews AFB, were tracking more unknown objects. A master sergeant at Andrews visually observed the objects; he later said that \"these lights did not have the characteristics of shooting stars. There was [sic] no trails . . . they traveled faster than any shooting star I have ever seen.\" Meanwhile, Albert M. Chop, the press spokesman for Project Blue Book, arrived at National Airport and, due to security concerns, denied several reporters\' requests to photograph the radar screens. He then joined the radar center personnel. By this time (9:30 p.m.) the radar center was picking up unknown objects in every sector. At times the objects traveled slowly; at other times they reversed direction and moved across the radarscope at speeds calculated at up to 7,000 mph (11,250 km/h). At 11:30 p.m., two U.S. Air Force F-94 Starfire jet fighters from New Castle Air Force Base in Delaware arrived over Washington. Captain John McHugo, the flight leader, was vectored towards the radar blips but saw nothing, despite repeated attempts. However, his wingman, Lieutenant William Patterson, did see four white \"glows\" and chased them. He later said that \"I tried to make contact with the bogies below 1,000 feet. I was at my maximum speed...I ceased chasing them because I saw no chance of overtaking them.\" According to Albert Chop, when ground control asked Patterson \"if he saw anything\", Patterson replied \"\'I see them now and they\'re all around me. What should I do?\'...And nobody answered, because we didn\'t know what to tell him.\"\nAfter midnight on July 27, Major Dewey Fournet, Project Blue Book\'s liaison at the Pentagon, and Lieutenant John Holcomb, a United States Navy radar specialist, arrived at the radar center at National Airport. During the night, Lieutenant Holcomb received a call from the Washington National Weather Station. They told him that a slight temperature inversion was present over the city, but Holcomb felt that the inversion was not \"nearly strong enough to explain the \'good and solid\' returns\" on the radarscopes. Fournet relayed that all those present in the radar room were convinced that the targets were most likely caused by solid metallic objects. There had been weather targets on the scope too, he said, but this was a common occurrence and the controllers \"were paying no attention to them.\" Two more F-94s from New Castle Air Force Base were scrambled during the night. One pilot saw nothing unusual; the other pilot saw a white light which \"vanished\" when he moved towards it. Additionally, \"civilian planes flying into Washington reported seeing strange glowing objects in places where the radar was getting blips.\" As on July 20, the sightings and unknown radar returns ended at sunrise.\n\n\n== White House concern and CIA interest ==\nThe sightings of July 26–27 also made front-page headlines, and led President Harry Truman to have his air force aide call Ruppelt and ask for an explanation of the sightings and unknown radar returns. Truman listened to the conversation between the two men on a separate phone, but did not ask questions himself. Ruppelt, remembering the conversation he had with Captain James, told the president\'s assistant that the sightings might have been caused by a temperature inversion, in which a layer of warm, moist air covers a layer of cool, dry air closer to the ground. This condition can cause radar signals to bend and give false returns. However, Ruppelt had not yet interviewed any of the witnesses or conducted a formal investigation.CIA historian Gerald Haines, in his 1997 history of the CIA\'s involvement with UFOs, also mentions Truman\'s concern. \"A massive buildup of sightings over the United States in 1952, especially in July, alarmed the Truman administration. On 19 and 20 July, radar scopes at Washington National Airport and Andrews Air Force Base tracked mysterious blips. On 27 July, the blips reappeared.\" The CIA would react to the 1952 wave of UFO reports by \"forming a special study group within the Office of Scientific Intelligence (OSI) and Office of Current Intelligence (OCI) to review the situation. Edward Tauss reported for the group that most UFO sightings could be easily explained. Nonetheless, he recommended that the Agency continue monitoring the problem.\" The CIA\'s concern with the issue would lead to the creation, in January 1953, of the Robertson Panel.\n\n\n== Air Force explanation ==\nTo calm public anxiety over the wave of UFO reports, answer the news media\'s questions about the sightings — and, hopefully, to slow down the numbers of UFO reports being sent to Blue Book, which were clogging normal intelligence channels — Air Force Major Generals John Samford, USAF Director of Intelligence, and Roger Ramey, USAF Director of Operations, held a well-attended press conference at the Pentagon on July 29, 1952. It was the largest Pentagon press conference since World War II. Press stories called Samford and Ramey the Air Force\'s two top UFO experts.Samford was heavily influenced by Captain Roy James, who had discussed the sightings with him earlier in the day and who also spoke at the conference. Samford declared that the visual sightings over Washington could be explained as misidentified aerial phenomena (such as stars or meteors). Samford also stated that the unknown radar targets could be explained by temperature inversion, which was present in the air over Washington on both nights the radar returns were reported.\nIn addition, Samford stated that the unknown radar contacts were not caused by solid material objects, and therefore posed no threat to national security. In response to a question as to whether the Air Force had recorded similar UFO radar contacts prior to the Washington incident, Samford said that there had been \"hundreds\" of such contacts where Air Force fighter interceptions had taken place, but stated they were all \"fruitless.\" The conference proved to be successful \"in getting the press off our backs\", Ruppelt later wrote.Among the witnesses who supported Samford\'s explanation was the crew of a B-25 bomber, which had been flying over Washington during the sightings of July 26–27. The bomber was vectored several times by National Airport over unknown targets on the airport\'s radarscopes, yet the crew could see nothing unusual. Finally, as a crew member related, \"the radar had a target which turned out to be the Wilson Lines steamboat trip to Mount Vernon... the radar was sure as hell picking up the steamboat.\" Air Force Captain Harold May was in the radar center at Andrews AFB during the sightings of July 19–20. Upon hearing that National Airport\'s radar had picked up an unknown object heading in his direction, May stepped outside and saw \"a light that was changing from red to orange to green to red again...at times it dipped suddenly and appeared to lose altitude.\" However, May eventually concluded that he was simply seeing a star that was distorted by the atmosphere, and that its \"movement\" was an illusion. At 3 a.m. on July 27, an Eastern Airlines flight over Washington was told that an unknown object was in its vicinity; the crew could see nothing unusual. When they were told that the object had moved directly behind their plane, they began a sharp turn to try to see the object, but were told by National Airport\'s radar center that the object had \"disappeared\" when they began their turn.\nAt the request of the Air Force, the CAA\'s Technical Development and Evaluation Center did an analysis of the radar sightings. Their conclusion was that \"a temperature inversion had been indicated in almost every instance when the unidentified radar targets or visual objects had been reported.\" Project Blue Book would eventually label the unknown Washington radar blips as false images caused by temperature inversion, and the visual sightings as misidentified meteors, stars, and city lights. In later years two prominent UFO skeptics, Dr. Donald Menzel, an astronomer at Harvard University, and Philip Klass, a senior editor for Aviation Week magazine, would also argue in favor of the temperature inversion/mirage hypothesis. In 2002 Klass told a reporter that \"radar technology in 1952 wasn\'t sophisticated enough to filter out many ordinary objects, such as flocks of birds, weather balloons, or temperature inversions.\" The reporter added that \"UFO proponents argue that even then seasoned controllers could differentiate between spurious targets and solid, metallic objects. Klass disagrees. It may be that \'we had two dumb controllers at National Airport on those nights\'...[Klass] added that the introduction of digital filters in the 1970s led to a steep decline in UFO sightings on radar.\"\n\n\n== Criticisms of the Air Force explanation ==\nAlmost from the moment of General Samford\'s press conference, eyewitnesses, UFO researchers, and Air Force personnel came forward to criticize the temperature inversion/mirage explanation. Captain Ruppelt noted that Major Fournet and Lt. Holcomb, who disagreed with the Air Force\'s explanation, were not in attendance at Samford\'s press conference. Ruppelt himself discovered that \"hardly a night passed in June, July, and August in 1952 that there wasn\'t a [temperature] inversion in Washington, yet the slow-moving, solid radar targets appeared on only a few nights.\"According to a story printed by INS, the United States Weather Bureau also disagreed with the temperature inversion hypothesis, one official stating that \"such an inversion ordinarily would appear on a radar screen as a steady line, rather than as single objects as were sighted on the airport radarscope.\"\nAlso, according to Ruppelt, when he was able to interview the radar and control tower personnel at Washington National Airport, not a single person agreed with the Air Force explanation. Michael Wertheimer, a researcher for the government-funded Condon Report, investigated the case in 1966. He found that the radar witnesses still disputed the Air Force explanation, but that did not stop the report from agreeing with the temperature inversion/mirage explanation. Ruppelt related that on July 27 the control tower at Washington National had called the control tower at Andrews AFB and notified them that their radar had an unknown object just south of the Andrews control tower, directly over the Andrews AFB radio range station. According to Ruppelt, when the Andrews control tower personnel looked they all saw \"a huge fiery-orange sphere\" hovering over the range station. When Ruppelt interviewed the tower personnel several days later, they insisted that they had been mistaken and had merely seen a bright star. However, when Ruppelt checked an astronomical chart he found that there were no bright stars over the station that night, and that he had \"heard from a good source that the tower men had been \'persuaded\' a bit\" by superior officers to claim that their sighting was merely a star.There were also witnesses who claimed to see structured craft and not merely \"glows\" or bright lights. On July 19 an Army artillery officer, Joseph Gigandet, was sitting on the front porch of his home in Alexandria, Virginia, across the Potomac River from Washington. At 9:30 p.m. he claimed to see \"a red cigar-shaped object\" which sailed slowly over his house. Gigandet estimated the object\'s size as comparable to a DC-7 airplane at about 10,000 feet altitude; he also claimed that the object had a \"series of lights very closely set together\" on its sides. The object eventually flew back over his house a second time, which led Gigandet to assume that it was circling the area. When the object flew away a second time, it turned a deeper red color and moved over the city of Washington itself; this occurred less than two hours before Edward Nugent first spotted the unknown objects on his radar at Washington National. Dr. James E. McDonald, a physicist at the University of Arizona and a prominent ufologist in the 1960s, did his own analysis of the Washington sightings, including speaking with four pilots and five radar personnel who were involved with the 1952 Washington incident. McDonald discussed his conclusions before the Committee on Science and Astronautics of the US House of Representatives. He told the committee that the temperature inversion theory used to explain the unknown radar traces was \"quite untenable\" and that, in his opinion, the 1952 Washington UFO incident was \"an instance of unidentified aerial objects over our Capital.\" Howard Cocklin, who was interviewed by McDonald about the incident, told a Washington Post reporter in 2002 that he was still \"convinced that he saw an object over Washington National...I saw it on the [radar] screen and out the window...it was a whitish-blue object. Not a light - a solid form...a saucer-shaped object.\"\n\n\n== The Robertson Panel ==\nThe extremely high numbers of UFO reports in 1952 disturbed both the Air Force and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). Both groups felt that an enemy nation could deliberately flood the U.S. with false UFO reports, causing mass panic and allowing them to launch a sneak attack. On September 24, 1952, the CIA\'s Office of Scientific Intelligence (OSI) sent a memorandum to Walter B. Smith, the CIA\'s Director. The memo stated that \"the flying saucer situation . . . have national security implications . . . [in] the public concern with the phenomena . . . lies the potential for the touching-off of mass hysteria and panic.\" The result of this memorandum was the creation in January 1953 of the Robertson Panel. Dr. Howard P. Robertson, a physicist, chaired the panel, which consisted of prominent scientists and which spent four days examining the \"best\" UFO cases collected by Project Blue Book. The panel dismissed nearly all of the UFO cases it examined as not representing anything unusual or threatening to national security. In the panel\'s controversial estimate, the Air Force and Project Blue Book needed to spend less time analyzing and studying UFO reports and more time publicly debunking them. The panel recommended that the Air Force and Project Blue Book should take steps to \"strip the Unidentified Flying Objects of the special status they have been given and the aura of mystery they have unfortunately acquired.\" Following the panel\'s recommendation, Project Blue Book would rarely publicize any UFO case that it had not labeled as \"solved\"; unsolved cases were rarely mentioned by the Air Force.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===\nClark, Jerome, The UFO Book: Encyclopedia of the Extraterrestrial.

(112, 'McMinnville UFO photographs', 'The McMinnville UFO photographs were taken on a farm near McMinnville, Oregon, United States, in 1950. The photos were reprinted in Life magazine and in newspapers across the nation, and are often considered to be among the most famous ever taken of a UFO. UFO skeptics believe that the photos are a hoax, but many ufologists continue to argue that the photos are genuine, and show an unidentified object in the sky.\n\n\n== Incident ==\n\nAlthough these images have become known as the \"McMinnville UFO Photographs\", Paul and Evelyn Trent\'s farm was actually just outside Sheridan, Oregon, approximately nine miles (15 km) southwest of McMinnville, which was the nearest larger town.According to astronomer William K. Hartmann\'s account, on 11 May 1950 at 7:30 p.m., Evelyn Trent was walking back to her farmhouse after feeding rabbits on her farm. Before reaching the house she claimed to see a slow-moving, metallic disk-shaped object heading in her direction from the northeast. She yelled for her husband, who was inside the house; upon leaving the house he claimed he also saw the object. After a short time he went back inside their home to obtain a camera; he said he managed to take two photos of the object before it sped away to the west. Paul Trent\'s father claimed he briefly viewed the object before it flew away.Hartmann\'s version of the incident traces back to an interview the Trents gave to Lou Gillette, host of the radio station KMCM (later KLYC), and quoted in The Oregonian newspaper on 10 June 1950. However, the Trents had given a slightly different version of the incident to the local McMinnville newspaper, the Telephone Register, two days earlier on 8 June 1950. In that version, Evelyn Trent stated \"We\'d been out in the back yard. Both of us saw the object at the same time. The camera! Paul thought it was in the car but I was sure it was in the house. I was right—and the Kodak was loaded with film...\"\n\n\n== Initial publicity ==\nThe roll of film in Paul Trent\'s camera was not entirely used up, so Trent did not have the film developed immediately. The film was not developed until the remaining frames were used in shooting family photographs for Mother\'s Day.In a 1997 interview, the Trents claimed that they initially thought the object they had photographed was a secret military aircraft, and feared the \"photos might bring them trouble.\" When he mentioned his sighting and photographs to his banker, Frank Wortmann, the banker was intrigued enough to display them from his bank window in McMinnville.Shortly afterwards Bill Powell, a local newspaper reporter, convinced Mr. Trent to loan him the negatives. Powell examined the negatives and found no evidence that they were tampered with or faked. On June 8, 1950, Powell\'s story of the incident—accompanied by the two photos—was published as a front-page story in the McMinnville Telephone-Register. The headline read: \"At Long Last—Authentic Photographs Of Flying Saucer[?]\"The story and photos were subsequently picked up by the International News Service (INS) and sent to other newspapers around the nation, thus giving them wide publicity. Life magazine published cropped versions of the photos on June 26, 1950, along with a photo of Trent and his camera. The Trents had been promised that the negatives would be returned to them; however, they were not returned—Life magazine told the Trents that it had misplaced the negatives.\n\n\n== Condon Committee investigation ==\nIn 1967 the negatives were found in the files of the United Press International (UPI), a news service which had merged with INS years earlier. The negatives were then loaned to Dr. William K. Hartmann, an astronomer who was working as an investigator for the Condon Committee, a government-funded UFO research project based at the University of Colorado Boulder. The Trents were not immediately informed that their \"lost\" negatives had been found. Hartmann interviewed the Trents and was impressed by their sincerity; the Trents never received any money for their photos, and he could find no evidence that they had sought any fame or fortune from them.In Hartmann\'s analysis, he wrote to the Condon Committee that \"This is one of the few UFO reports in which all factors investigated, geometric, psychological, and physical, appear to be consistent with the assertion that an extraordinary flying object, silvery, metallic, disk-shaped, tens of meters in diameter, and evidently artificial, flew within sight of two witnesses.\"One reason for this conclusion was due to the photometric analysis of the images. Hartmann noted that the brightness of the underside of the object appeared to be lighter than the underside of the oil tank seen in the images. This could be due to the effects of atmospheric extinction and scattering, the same effects that make distant mountains appear \"washed out\" and blue. This effect suggested the objects were further from the camera than the tank, not small, local objects.\"Hartmann did, however, also point out the possibility that the images were manufactured. He noted that \"The object appears beneath a pair of wires, as is seen in Plates 23 and 24. We may question, therefore, whether it could have been a model suspended from one of the wires. This possibility is strengthened by the observation that the object appears beneath roughly the same point in the two photos, in spite of their having been taken from two positions.\" and concludes \"These tests do not rule out the possibility that the object was a small model suspended from the nearby wire by an unresolved thread.\"Hartmann also noticed a discrepancy that would later become the main point of objection for later skeptics. He noticed that the overall lighting of the image was consistent with the lighting that would be expected around sunset, but noted that \"There could be a possible discrepancy in view of the fact that the UFO, the telephone pole, possibly the garage at the left, and especially the distant house gables (left of the distant barn) are illuminated from the right, or east. The house, in particular, appears to have a shadow under its roof that would suggest a daylit photo, and combined with the eastward incidence, one could argue that the photos were taken on a dull, sunlit day at, say, 10 a.m.\"After Hartmann concluded his investigation he returned the negatives to UPI, which then informed the Trents about them. In 1970 the Trents asked Philip Bladine, the editor of the News-Register (the successor of the Telephone-Register), for the negatives; the Trents noted that they had never been paid for the negatives and thus wanted them back. Bladine asked UPI to return the negatives, which it did. However, for some reason Bladine never told the Trents that the negatives had been returned.\n\n\n== Maccabee analysis ==\nIn 1975 the negatives were found in the files of the News-Register by Bruce Maccabee, an optical physicist for the U.S. Navy and a ufologist. After completing his own study of the photos, Maccabee ensured that the original negatives were finally returned to the Trents.Maccabee analyzed the photos and concluded that the photographs were not hoaxed and showed a \"real, physical\" object in the sky above the Trent farm. Much of his analysis is based on densitometric measurements, similar to the photometric analysis done by Hartmann. Maccabee argued that the brightness of the object\'s underside suggested it was at some distance from the camera, not a smaller object close to it.Maccabee also analyzed the position of various objects in the image as well as an image prepared by Hartmann when he visited the site in June 1967. Based on this, Maccabee argued that the line-of-sight of the two images intersected some distance behind the power lines seen in the photos, providing further evidence, in his opinion, that it was not a small model suspended from the lines. Maccabee stated that his analysis of the object did not find any evidence of a thread or string suspending it from the power lines.In reply to the skeptical arguments that shadows on objects in the photos proved that they were taken in the morning rather than in the early evening, as the Trents had claimed, Maccabee argued that cloud conditions in the McMinnville area on the evening of the sighting could have caused the shadows on the garage. He also stated, in response to the 2013 IPACO photoanalysis that concluded the photos were a hoax, that \"regarding [their] photogrammetric analysis, I showed that the sighting lines did not cross under the wires and they did not refute this...I still stand on my original work.\"\n\n\n== Suggested Hoax Explanation ==\n\nIn the 1980s Philip J. Klass and Robert Sheaffer, journalists and notable skeptics, stated their belief that the photos were faked, and that the entire event was a hoax.Their primary argument stated that shadows on a garage on the left-hand side of the photos proved that the photos were taken in the morning rather than in the early evening, as the Trents had claimed. Klass and Sheaffer argued that since the Trents had apparently lied about the time the photos were taken, their entire story was thus suspect. They also claimed that the Trents had shown an interest in UFOs prior to their alleged sighting.Additionally, their analysis of the photos suggested that the object photographed was small and likely a model hanging from power lines visible at the top of the photos. They also believed the object may have been the detached side-view mirror of a vehicle. The object has a shape that is very similar to the round mirrors that were used on Ford vehicles for decades, or similar models on almost all vehicles of the era.Additionally, Klass claimed to have found a number of contradictions in the Trents\' story of the sighting, and noted that their version of the incident changed over the years. His conclusion was that the Trents had hoaxed the event.When Sheaffer sent his research and conclusions to William Hartmann, Hartmann withdrew the positive assessment of the case he had sent to the Condon Committee.In April 2013, three researchers with IPACO posted two studies to their website entitled \"Back to McMinnville pictures\" and \"Evidence of a suspension thread.\" They argued that the geometry of the photographs is most consistent with a small model with a hollow bottom hanging from a wire suspended from the power lines above, and they stated that they had detected the presence of a thread above the object. Their conclusion was that \"the clear result of this study was that the McMinnville UFO was a model hanging from a thread.\"\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nThe McMinnville UFO photographs remain among the best-publicized in UFO history. Skeptics continue to explain the two photographs as being hoaxes and/or fakes. Ufologists continue to argue that the Trent photos are credible evidence that UFOs are a real, physical phenomenon. Evelyn Trent died in 1997 and Paul Trent in 1998; they both insisted their entire lives that the sighting, and the photos, were genuine. The interest surrounding the Trent UFO photos led to an annual \"UFO Festival\" being established in McMinnville; it is now the largest such gathering in the Pacific Northwest, and is the second-largest UFO festival in the nation after the one held in Roswell, New Mexico.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nA critical analysis of the Trent photos from Robert Sheaffer\'s website The Debunker\'s Domain\nBruce Maccabee\'s rebuttal to the Klass-Sheaffer explanation\nDiscussion of overlooked aspects of the Trent case from \"Historical Inquiry\" blog\nA ufologist offers a rebuttal of the IPACO skeptical analysis', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/11/1961_Ford_F100_Unibody_pickup_design_factory_original_at_2015_Shenandoah_AACA_meet_4of6.jpg'),
(113, 'List of unexplained explosion events', 'Many explosions recorded in Earth\'s atmosphere are likely caused by the air burst that results from a meteor exploding as it hits the thicker part of the atmosphere. These types of meteors are also known as fireballs or bolides with the brightest known as superbolides. Before entering Earth\'s atmosphere, these larger meteors were originally asteroids and comets of a few to several tens of meters in diameter, contrasting with the much smaller and much more common \"shooting stars\".\nThe most powerful recorded air burst is the 1908 Tunguska event. Extremely bright fireballs traveling across the sky are often witnessed from a distance, such as the 1947 Sikhote-Alin meteor and the 2013 Chelyabinsk meteor, both in Russia. If the bolide is large enough, fragments may survive such as the Chelyabinsk meteorite. Modern developments in infrasound detection by the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization and infrared Defense Support Program satellite technology have increased the likelihood of detecting airbursts.\n\n\n== Frequency ==\nThe table from Earth Impact Effects Program (EIEP) estimates the average frequency of airbursts and their energy yield in kilotons (kt) or megatons (Mt) of TNT equivalent.\n\n\n== Events ==\n\nWhile airbursts undoubtedly happened prior to the 20th century, reliable reports of such are quite scanty. A relatively well-documented case is the 1490 Ch\'ing-yang event which has an unknown energy yield but was apparently powerful enough to cause 10,000 deaths. Modern researchers are skeptical about the figure, but had the Tunguska event occurred over a highly populous district, it could have caused similar destruction.Depending on the estimate, there were only 3–4 known airbursts in the 20th century with energy yield greater than 80 kilotons (in 1908, 1930, 1932, and 1963), roughly consistent with the estimate of the EIEP table. Most values for the 1930 Curuçá River event put it below 1 megaton.The first airburst of the 21st century with yield greater than 100 kilotons came from the 2013 Chelyabinsk meteor, which had an estimated diameter of 20 meters.\nThe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization and modern technology has improved multiple detection of airbursts with energy yield 1–2 kilotons every year within the last decade. The table below contains a chronological list of events with yield at least 3 kilotons since 2005, with earlier or smaller events included if widely covered in the media.\n\n\n=== Airbursts per year ===\nAs of January 2018, the number of airbursts each year since 2005, as reported in the JPL Fireball and Bolide Reports are:\n\n\n== See also ==\n1972 Great Daylight Fireball – assumed to be still in an Earth-crossing orbit\n2007 Carancas impact event – mostly intact until object hit the ground\nImpact event\nAsteroid impact prediction\nMeteorite fall\nList of bolides\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nBrown, P.

(114, 'Chiles-Whitted UFO encounter', 'The Chiles-Whitted UFO encounter occurred on July 24, 1948 in the skies near Montgomery, Alabama. Two commercial pilots, Clarence S. Chiles and John B. Whitted, claimed that at approximately 2:45 AM on July 24 they observed a \"glowing object\" pass by their plane before it appeared to pull up into a cloud and travel out of sight. According to Air Force officer and Project Blue Book supervisor Edward J. Ruppelt, the Chiles-Whitted sighting was one of three \"classic\" UFO incidents in 1948 that convinced the personnel of Project Sign, Blue Book\'s predecessor, \"that UFOs were real.\" However, later studies by Air Force and civilian researchers indicated that Chiles and Whitted had seen a meteor, possibly a bolide, and in 1959 Project Blue Book formally stated that a meteor was the cause of the incident.\n\n\n== The incident ==\nIn the early morning hours of July 24, 1948, Clarence Chiles, chief pilot, and John Whitted, co-pilot, were flying an Eastern Airlines Douglas DC-3 passenger plane near Montgomery, at about 5,000 feet altitude. The night sky was clear with \"the Moon, four days past full, shining through scattered clouds.\"At about 2:45 AM, Chiles \"saw a dull red glow above and ahead of the aircraft.\" He told Whitted \"Look, here comes a new Army jet job.\" The object closed on their DC-3 in a matter of seconds, and both men later said they saw the object fly past the right side of their plane at high speed before it pulled \"up with a tremendous burst of flame out of its rear and zoomed up into the clouds.\" They observed the object for a total of 10 to 15 seconds. Chiles and Whitted stated that the object \"looked like a wingless aircraft...it seemed to have two rows of windows through which glowed a very bright light, as brilliant as a magnesium flare.\" Both pilots claimed the object was 100 feet long and 25-30 feet in diameter, torpedo-or-cigar shaped, \"similar to a B-29 fuselage\", with flames coming out of its tail. Only one of the plane\'s passengers, C.L. McKelvie, saw anything unusual. He reported seeing a \"bright streak of light\" that flashed by his window.\n\n\n== Investigation and explanation ==\nShortly after landing in Atlanta, Georgia, Chiles and Whitted reported their sighting to the US Air Force. They were interviewed by personnel from Project Sign, the first Air Force research group assigned to investigate UFO sightings. The personnel found that the two pilots did disagree on some details: Chiles claimed to see a lighted cockpit, long boom on the nose of the object, and the center section was transparent. Whitted did not see a cockpit or boom, and instead of the center section being transparent he claimed to see a series of rectangular windows. Neither pilot had heard any sound, and although some books and articles would later claim the plane had been hit by turbulence from the object, both pilots and the passenger who saw the \"streak of light\" stated that the plane was not affected at all by the object.USAF Captain Edward Ruppelt would write that \"according to the old-timers at ATIC (Air Technical Intelligence Center), the [Chiles-Whitted] report shook them worse than the Mantell Incident... this was the first time two reliable sources had been really close enough to a UFO to get a good look.\" Project Sign\'s personnel developed a map of the object\'s trajectory which showed that it would have passed over Macon, Georgia. When an Air Force crew chief at Robins Air Force Base near Macon reported seeing \"an extremely bright light pass overhead at high speed\" on the same night as the Chiles-Whitted incident, it \"seemed to confirm the [Chiles-Whitted] sighting\", Ruppelt wrote. According to Ruppelt, as a result of the Chiles-Whitted incident and earlier sightings in 1947 and 1948, Project Sign\'s personnel decided to send an \"Estimate of the Situation\" to Air Force Chief of Staff Hoyt S. Vandenberg. The Estimate of the Situation \"was a rather thick document with a black cover... stamped across the front were the words TOP SECRET.\" Project Sign\'s conclusion \"was that [UFOs] were interplanetary!\"However, Gen. Vandenberg rejected the Estimate of the Situation in October 1948, citing that \"the report\'s evidence was insufficient to support its conclusions.\" Additionally, Dr. J. Allen Hynek, an astronomer at Ohio State University and a scientific consultant to Project Sign, concluded that Chiles and Whitted had actually seen a very bright meteor. Dr. Hynek noted that \"the flaming tail and sudden disappearance were consistent with the brief passage of a meteor.\" Hynek also stated that a large number of bright meteors had been observed by amateur astronomers on the night of July 23-24. As for the rectangular windows and cockpit that Chiles and Whitted claimed to have seen on the object, Hynek wrote that \"It will have to be left to the psychologists to tell us whether the immediate trail of a bright meteor could produce the subjective impression of a ship with lighted windows.\" Although a Project Sign officer disagreed with Dr. Hynek\'s explanation, arguing that \"it is obvious that this object was not a meteor\" and that the object should remain labeled as unidentified, later researchers supported Dr. Hynek\'s conclusion. Dr. Donald Menzel, an astronomer at Harvard University and a prominent UFO skeptic of that era, noted that July 24 \"falls into a period of greatly increased meteor activity, when the Earth is moving through the Aquarid streams...the reports [from amateur astronomers] for the Southeast for [July 24] have particular interest for the Chiles-Whitted case.\" On the night of July 24 an observer in Alabama \"counted fifteen meteors in one hour\'s watching.\" Two days after the Chiles-Whitted sighting, a \"huge fireball flashed over North Carolina and Tennessee.\" Menzel wrote that \"when Chiles and Whitted observed the UFO, its appearance and motion were identical with those of many other bright meteors but the pilots, startled by the sudden apparition [of the meteor] misinterpreted what they saw... there can be no doubt that Chiles and Whitted misinterpreted the appearance of an unusually bright meteor, its body glowing to white and blue incandescence... shooting off flaming gases (the \"exhaust\") and vaporizing from the friction of the atmosphere.\"Menzel also recounted the experience of a pilot in 1959 who described a fiery object very similar to the one experienced by Chiles and Whitted, but which the pilot eventually recognized to be a brilliant meteor. Philip Klass, another prominent UFO skeptic, agreed with the meteor explanation, writing that the original Project Sign conclusion that the object was an interplanetary spacecraft was \"grossly in error.\" Although Dr. James E. McDonald, a physicist at the University of Arizona and a prominent ufologist, would interview Chiles and Whitted in the 1960s and conclude that they had not seen a meteor, the US Air Force, based on the analysis of Dr. Hynek, Dr. Menzel, and others, in 1959 would label the Chiles-Whitted incident as having been caused by a fireball-type meteor.\n\n\n== See also ==\nUFO sightings in the United States\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Chiles-Whitted Encounter from UFO casebook', '');

(115, 'Morristown UFO', 'The Morristown UFO hoax was originally thought to be an unidentified aerial event, of mysterious floating red lights, that occurred near Morristown, New Jersey, on Monday, January 5, 2009, between 8:15 pm and 9:00 pm. The lights were later observed on 4 other days: January 26, January 29, February 7, and February 17, 2009. The events were actually a hoax, meant as a social experiment.Five flare lights attached to helium balloons were released by Joe Rudy and Chris Russo and seen in the skies above Morris County, New Jersey. Sightings were concentrated in the towns of Hanover Township, Morristown, Morris Plains, Madison, and Florham Park.\nOn January 5, 2009, at 8:28 pm, the Hanover Township police department received the first of seven 9-1-1 calls. Neighboring police departments also received numerous phone calls with regard to the strange lights. Morristown Police Lt. Jim Cullen alerted Morristown Airport about a possible hazard to airplanes. Airport control tower workers reported seeing the lights in the sky, but could not determine what they were. Hanover Township police also contacted the Morristown Airport to try to pick up the objects on radar, but they were unable to pick up anything.Major and local news networks covered the story, and Internet websites, including the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON), have posted information about the incident. On April 1, 2009, Rudy and Russo came forward with video evidence proving they were the perpetrators of this hoax, demonstrating how easy it is to fool the so-called UFO \"experts.\"On April 7, 2009, Russo and Rudy pleaded guilty to municipal charges of disorderly conduct and were sentenced to fines of $250 and 50 hours of community service.On July 18, 2009, Russo and Rudy were the guest speakers for the New York City Skeptics at a public lecture in New York City, describing how they pulled off their hoax and the reasoning behind why they performed the hoax. On August 5, 2009, Russo was asked to debate a MUFON investigator on the existence of UFOs. The Morristown UFO Hoax was declared one of the best hoaxes ever on a program that aired on TruTV on April 1, 2015. Russo and Rudy were guests on the show.\n\n\n== Revealing the hoax ==\nOn April 1, 2009, Russo and Rudy went public  announcing that they had perpetrated this hoax to \"show everyone how unreliable eyewitness accounts are, along with investigators of UFOs.\" As at least one police report suspected, Russo and Rudy had launched flares tied to helium balloons. Russo and Rudy described in detail how and why they perpetrated this hoax, and provided links to videos showing their preparations, the launch, and subsequent media coverage and involvement.\n\n\n== Accounts quoted in media ==\nTwo men from the Morristown area claimed to see the lights while driving on Hanover Avenue in Morris Plains. They recorded several videos and still photos of the event, which have been posted on news stations, websites, blogs, and YouTube. Rudy and Russo were interviewed on News 12 New Jersey, where they offered what would later be revealed to be a fictitious account of their sighting. They have since come forward as the perpetrators of the hoax resulting in the Morristown sightings. In the interview, Russo stated, \"We were driving on Hanover, when all of a sudden we see these lights literally zip over our car.\" Rudy stated, \"The lights seemed to ascend and descend almost in a sequence. They would rise up slowly and dip down.\"\nA family in Hanover Township reported seeing the lights from their home. An 11-year-old, Kristin Hurley was the first to notice the lights. Paul Hurley, a pilot, saw the lights and said they were not planes. The Hurley Family took video of the lights, which appeared on Fox News. Hurley stated, \"I have been in the aviation industry for 20 years and have never seen anything like this, a little scary, little scary.\"\nA Morristown resident said that he saw an L-shaped formation oscillating in the sky. Bender was interviewed by the Morris County newspaper Daily Record. Bender stated that, what he saw \"didn\'t seem manmade\" and, \"No way this could have been weather balloons.\"\nHanover Township\'s health officer said that he saw the lights while walking his dog in Madison at 8:38 pm. In contrast to local police reports, Van Orden stated the lights did not appear to be flares because they did not leave trails. He also said that they sometimes appeared to move against the wind, \"These things were moving fast, holding formation, and then moving in three different directions; I don\'t know what it was.\"\n\n\n== Initial explanations and hoax theories ==\nBefore Chris Russo and Joe Rudy came forward, there had been many different explanations for the lights. These included extraterrestrial craft, supernatural and/or spiritual phenomena, helicopters carrying cargo, a surveillance blimp, a secret military project, or an elaborate hoax.The Morristown police department had stated the lights were most likely road flares attached to helium balloons, although witnesses and many other Morris County residents did not agree with this claim. \"We are reasonably certain, from what we were able to observe,\" Morristown Police Lt. James Cullen told the Bergen Record, \"that they were red flares attached to a balloon.\"\nReporters from News 12 NJ contacted Peter Davenport who has been director of the National UFO Reporting Center since 1994. By telephone he told News12 NJ that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) requires aircraft to have a single red light on the left tip of the wing. He did not believe it was an aircraft. In addition to serving as the director of the National UFO Reporting Center, Davenport has served as the director of investigations for the Washington Chapter of the Mutual UFO Network.One source had speculated that the red lights may have been sky lanterns released during a celebration.\n\n\n== Reappearances ==\nChris Russo and Joe Rudy built up the media attention by repeating the hoax over various parts of Morris County on four more occasions after the January 5 incident. The subsequent hoaxes and sightings took place on January 26, January 29, February 7, and February 17.The largest cluster of lights occurred on February 17. Nine red lights were reported to be traveling in formation. Shortly after that sighting, Capt. Jeff Paul, a spokesman for Morris County Prosecutor Robert A. Bianchi, said that federal authorities have expressed concern that the objects might be a threat to flights on their final approach to Newark Liberty International Airport. The Federal Aviation Administration advised Paul that they would issue an advisory to aircraft in the area. Paul said “numerous” 911 calls were received on the evening of February 17 in Morris Plains, Morristown, Morris Township, Hanover, Denville, Parsippany, Montville and the Morris County Communications Dispatch center. The lights appeared to be traveling north, he said, and air traffic controllers at Morristown Airport reported that they appeared to be at an altitude of about 2,500 feet (760 m).Dorian Vicente, 46, of Parsippany, said the lights caused traffic to slow on Route 80 East in Denville at 8:40 p.m. as people watched them floating overhead. There were nine lights, she said, and they were scattered at first. Then she said they aligned in a straight line. That is when she and several other cars pulled to the side of the highway to try to capture the lights on video. \"It was the weirdest thing,\" she said. Ray Vargas, a witness to the lights on February 17, believed he witnessed something extraordinary. When interviewed by the media he stated, \"If it\'s a hoax, it\'s a real good hoax. There were no flares, no streaks … they were almost as if they were communicating with each other.\"Officials with the Morris County prosecutor\'s office called the military and determined that no military flights were in the area, Paul said. The prosecutor\'s office also contacted the FAA, the Office of Homeland Security and Preparedness, and the New Jersey State Police Regional Operations Intelligence Center.\n\n\n== Conviction ==\nProsecutor Robert Bianchi used what he called a \"measured approach\" and filed disorderly-person charges, rather than charges of indictable offenses. Bianchi criticized the defendants for wasting police resources, posing a fire threat, and posing an aviation threat. The defendants plea-bargained and received a sentence fine of $250 each and 50 hours of community service at the Hanover Recreation Commission.\n\n\n== In the media ==\nDavid Letterman referenced the incident in the opening monologue of his television show, Late Show with David Letterman, on January 8, 2009, in which he stated:\n\n\"A couple of days ago, there were UFO sightings in New Jersey. But don\'t worry, it\'s not an invasion – they were just looking for a place to dump a body. The aliens were just here looking for some of that bailout money.\"The Morristown UFO has been featured on the homepage of the American documentary television series UFO Hunters. Host Bill Birnes investigated the January 5, 2009, sighting and interviewed several eyewitnesses. Throughout the two-part mini-documentary, Bill Birnes and his team do not accept previous skeptic claims that the lights could have been Chinese lanterns or flares. \"We know this couldn\'t be flares attached to a rigid structure.\"\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of UFO sightings\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nUfoSightingsToday.org Morristown UFO Hoax report\nRudy and Russo\'s video', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a3/Morristown_UFO_January_2009.jpg'),
(116, 'Manises UFO incident', 'The Manises UFO incident took place on 11 November 1979, forcing a commercial flight of the Spanish company Transportes Aéreos Españoles, with 109 passengers, to make an emergency landing at the Manises\' airport in Valencia, Spain, when they were flying over Ibiza. After the emergency landing, a Spanish Air Force fighter aircraft took off from Los Llanos Base in order to intercept the mysterious object.It is the most famous UFO sighting in Spain.\n\n\n== Incident Details ==\nA TAE Supercaravelle was the first aircraft involved in the incident. Flight JK-297 had taken off from Salzburg (Austria) with 109 passengers on board, and had made a refuelling stop on the island Mallorca before setting course towards Las Palmas.\nHalfway through the flight, at about 23:00h, Pilot Francisco Javier Lerdo de Tejada and his crew noticed a set of red lights that were fast approaching the aircraft. These lights appeared to be on a collision course with the aircraft, alarming the crew. The captain requested information about the inexplicable lights, but neither the military radar of Torrejón de Ardoz (Madrid) nor the flight control center in Barcelona could provide any explanation for this phenomenon.\nIn order to avoid a possible collision, the captain changed altitude. However, the lights mirrored the new course and stayed about half a kilometer away from the plane. Since the object was violating all elementary safety rules and an evasive maneuver was deemed impossible by the crew, the captain decided on going off-course and made an emergency landing in Manises\' airport. This was the first time in history in which a commercial flight was forced to make an emergency landing because of a UFO.\nThe flight crew reported the lights abandoning the pursuit just before the landing took place. However, three new UFO signals were detected by the radar, each one with an estimated diameter of 200 meters. The objects were seen by several witnesses. One of the UFOs passed very close to the airport runway, and emergency lights were lit by the land crew in case the object happened to be an unregistered flight experiencing difficulties.\nGiven the lack of answer to all communication attempts, a Mirage F-1 took off from the nearby airbase of Los Llanos (Albacete) to identify the phenomenon. The pilot, Spanish Air Force captain Fernando Cámara, had to increase his speed to mach 1.4 just to be able to get visual contact with what he perceived to be a truncated cone shape displaying a changing bright color, but despite his initial efforts the object quickly disappeared from sight. The pilot was informed of a new radar echo, which indicated that another object might be near Sagunto (Valencia).\nWhen the pilot was close enough, the object accelerated and disappeared again. This time, though, the UFO seemed to respond and the fighter had its avionics scrambled -its electronic flight systems were jammed. At last, and after a third contact attempt, the UFO finally disappeared, heading for Africa. After an hour and a half of pursuit, and due to fuel shortage, the pilot was forced to return to the base with no results.\n\n\n== Possible Explanations ==\nThe public impact of the incident was such that on September 1980 it reached the Cortes Generales (the Spanish Parliament). The High Chamber representative Enrique Múgica Herzog publicly asked for an official explanation, but a UFO sighting was dismissed and the incident was attributed to a series of freak optical illusions.\nThe full official report, declassified by the Spanish Air Force on August 1994, states that the Supercaravelle JK-297 pilot Javier Saenz de Tejada, the land crew in Manises\' airport and the Air Force Captain Fernando Cámara might have been misled by \"flashes emitted from a distant chemical industry complex\" (about 100 miles away from Manises) \"and some stars and planets\". Although this possibility has been much argued and repeatedly rejected by all people involved, it stands as the only non-UFO-related explanation. \nThe on-flight difficulties experienced by the fighter were not mentioned in the public release. The electronic system failure on board the Mirage F-1 could nevertheless be explained by the fact that the United States Sixth Fleet was stationed in the area, and was making use of a powerful electronic warfare equipment while awaiting the outcome of the Iran hostage crisis. The F-1 combat pilot, Fernando Cámara, denied such possibility saying that the Sixth Fleet was too far and furthermore his systems got jammed when he tried to block the UFO with an IR missile.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of UFO sightings\n\n\n== External links ==\nTestimony of Fernando Cámara, pilot of the Mirage F-1 (in Spanish)\nRational explanation of the phenomena, by the Anomaly Foundation (in English)', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg');

(117, 'Outer space', 'Outer space, or just space, is the expanse that exists beyond the Earth and between celestial bodies. Outer space is not completely empty—it is a hard vacuum containing a low density of particles, predominantly a plasma of hydrogen and helium as well as electromagnetic radiation, magnetic fields, neutrinos, dust, and cosmic rays. The baseline temperature, as set by the background radiation from the Big Bang, is 2.7 kelvins (−270.45 °C; −454.81 °F). The plasma between galaxies accounts for about half of the baryonic (ordinary) matter in the universe; it has a number density of less than one hydrogen atom per cubic metre and a temperature of millions of kelvins; local concentrations of this plasma have condensed into stars and galaxies. Studies indicate that 90% of the mass in most galaxies is in an unknown form, called dark matter, which interacts with other matter through gravitational but not electromagnetic forces. Observations suggest that the majority of the mass-energy in the observable universe is a poorly understood vacuum energy of space, which astronomers label dark energy. Intergalactic space takes up most of the volume of the Universe, but even galaxies and star systems consist almost entirely of empty space.\nOuter space does not begin at a definite altitude above the Earth\'s surface. However, the Kármán line, an altitude of 100 km (62 mi) above sea level, is conventionally used as the start of outer space in space treaties and for aerospace records keeping. The framework for international space law was established by the Outer Space Treaty, which entered into force on 10 October 1967. This treaty precludes any claims of national sovereignty and permits all states to freely explore outer space. Despite the drafting of UN resolutions for the peaceful uses of outer space, anti-satellite weapons have been tested in Earth orbit.\nHumans began the physical exploration of space during the 20th century with the advent of high-altitude balloon flights, followed by manned rocket launches. Earth orbit was first achieved by Yuri Gagarin of the Soviet Union in 1961, and unmanned spacecraft have since reached all of the known planets in the Solar System. Due to the high cost of getting into space, manned spaceflight has been limited to low Earth orbit and the Moon.\nOuter space represents a challenging environment for human exploration because of the hazards of vacuum and radiation. Microgravity also has a negative effect on human physiology that causes both muscle atrophy and bone loss. In addition to these health and environmental issues, the economic cost of putting objects, including humans, into space is very high.\n\n\n== Discovery ==\nIn 350 BCE, Greek philosopher Aristotle suggested that nature abhors a vacuum, a principle that became known as the horror vacui. This concept built upon a 5th-century BCE ontological argument by the Greek philosopher Parmenides, who denied the possible existence of a void in space. Based on this idea that a vacuum could not exist, in the West it was widely held for many centuries that space could not be empty. As late as the 17th century, the French philosopher René Descartes argued that the entirety of space must be filled.In ancient China, the 2nd-century astronomer Zhang Heng became convinced that space must be infinite, extending well beyond the mechanism that supported the Sun and the stars. The surviving books of the Hsüan Yeh school said that the heavens were boundless, \"empty and void of substance\". Likewise, the \"sun, moon, and the company of stars float in the empty space, moving or standing still\".The Italian scientist Galileo Galilei knew that air had mass and so was subject to gravity. In 1640, he demonstrated that an established force resisted the formation of a vacuum. However, it would remain for his pupil Evangelista Torricelli to create an apparatus that would produce a partial vacuum in 1643. This experiment resulted in the first mercury barometer and created a scientific sensation in Europe. The French mathematician Blaise Pascal reasoned that if the column of mercury was supported by air, then the column ought to be shorter at higher altitude where the air pressure is lower. In 1648, his brother-in-law, Florin Périer, repeated the experiment on the Puy de Dôme mountain in central France and found that the column was shorter by three inches. This decrease in pressure was further demonstrated by carrying a half-full balloon up a mountain and watching it gradually expand, then contract upon descent.\n\nIn 1650, German scientist Otto von Guericke constructed the first vacuum pump: a device that would further refute the principle of horror vacui. He correctly noted that the atmosphere of the Earth surrounds the planet like a shell, with the density gradually declining with altitude. He concluded that there must be a vacuum between the Earth and the Moon.Back in the 15th century, German theologian Nicolaus Cusanus speculated that the Universe lacked a center and a circumference. He believed that the Universe, while not infinite, could not be held as finite as it lacked any bounds within which it could be contained. These ideas led to speculations as to the infinite dimension of space by the Italian philosopher Giordano Bruno in the 16th century. He extended the Copernican heliocentric cosmology to the concept of an infinite Universe filled with a substance he called aether, which did not resist the motion of heavenly bodies. English philosopher William Gilbert arrived at a similar conclusion, arguing that the stars are visible to us only because they are surrounded by a thin aether or a void. This concept of an aether originated with ancient Greek philosophers, including Aristotle, who conceived of it as the medium through which the heavenly bodies move.The concept of a Universe filled with a luminiferous aether remained in vogue among some scientists until the early 20th century. This form of aether was viewed as the medium through which light could propagate. In 1887, the Michelson–Morley experiment tried to detect the Earth\'s motion through this medium by looking for changes in the speed of light depending on the direction of the planet\'s motion. However, the null result indicated something was wrong with the concept. The idea of the luminiferous aether was then abandoned. It was replaced by Albert Einstein\'s theory of special relativity, which holds that the speed of light in a vacuum is a fixed constant, independent of the observer\'s motion or frame of reference.The first professional astronomer to support the concept of an infinite Universe was the Englishman Thomas Digges in 1576. But the scale of the Universe remained unknown until the first successful measurement of the distance to a nearby star in 1838 by the German astronomer Friedrich Bessel. He showed that the star 61 Cygni had a parallax of just 0.31 arcseconds (compared to the modern value of 0.287″). This corresponds to a distance of over 10 light years. In 1917, Heber Curtis noted that novae in spiral nebulae were, on average, 10 magnitudes fainter than galactic novae, suggesting that the former are 100 times further away. The distance to the Andromeda Galaxy was determined in 1923 by American astronomer Edwin Hubble by measuring the brightness of cepheid variables in that galaxy, a new technique discovered by Henrietta Leavitt. This established that the Andromeda galaxy, and by extension all galaxies, lay well outside the Milky Way.The modern concept of outer space is based on the \"Big Bang\" cosmology, first proposed in 1931 by the Belgian physicist Georges Lemaître. This theory holds that the universe originated from a very dense form that has since undergone continuous expansion.\nThe earliest known estimate of the temperature of outer space was by the Swiss physicist Charles É. Guillaume in 1896. Using the estimated radiation of the background stars, he concluded that space must be heated to a temperature of 5–6 K. British physicist Arthur Eddington made a similar calculation to derive a temperature of 3.18 K in 1926. German physicist Erich Regener used the total measured energy of cosmic rays to estimate an intergalactic temperature of 2.8 K in 1933. American physicists Ralph Alpher and Robert Herman predicted 5 K for the temperature of space in 1948, based on the gradual decrease in background energy following the then-new Big Bang theory. The modern measurement of the cosmic microwave background is about 2.7K.\nThe term outward space was used in 1842 by the English poet Lady Emmeline Stuart-Wortley in her poem \"The Maiden of Moscow\". The expression outer space was used as an astronomical term by Alexander von Humboldt in 1845. It was later popularized in the writings of H. G. Wells in 1901. The shorter term space is older, first used to mean the region beyond Earth\'s sky in John Milton\'s Paradise Lost in 1667.\n\n\n== Formation and state ==\n\nAccording to the Big Bang theory, the very early Universe was an extremely hot and dense state about 13.8 billion years ago which rapidly expanded. About 380,000 years later the Universe had cooled sufficiently to allow protons and electrons to combine and form hydrogen—the so-called recombination epoch. When this happened, matter and energy became decoupled, allowing photons to travel freely through the continually expanding space. Matter that remained following the initial expansion has since undergone gravitational collapse to create stars, galaxies and other astronomical objects, leaving behind a deep vacuum that forms what is now called outer space. As light has a finite velocity, this theory also constrains the size of the directly observable universe. This leaves open the question as to whether the Universe is finite or infinite.\nThe present day shape of the universe has been determined from measurements of the cosmic microwave background using satellites like the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe. These observations indicate that the spatial geometry of the observable universe is \"flat\", meaning that photons on parallel paths at one point remain parallel as they travel through space to the limit of the observable universe, except for local gravity. The flat Universe, combined with the measured mass density of the Universe and the accelerating expansion of the Universe, indicates that space has a non-zero vacuum energy, which is called dark energy.Estimates put the average energy density of the present day Universe at the equivalent of 5.9 protons per cubic meter, including dark energy, dark matter, and baryonic matter (ordinary matter composed of atoms). The atoms account for only 4.6% of the total energy density, or a density of one proton per four cubic meters. The density of the Universe, however, is clearly not uniform; it ranges from relatively high density in galaxies—including very high density in structures within galaxies, such as planets, stars, and black holes—to conditions in vast voids that have much lower density, at least in terms of visible matter. Unlike matter and dark matter, dark energy seems not to be concentrated in galaxies: although dark energy may account for a majority of the mass-energy in the Universe, dark energy\'s influence is 5 orders of magnitude smaller than the influence of gravity from matter and dark matter within the Milky Way.\n\n\n== Environment ==\n\nOuter space is the closest known approximation to a perfect vacuum. It has effectively no friction, allowing stars, planets, and moons to move freely along their ideal orbits, following the initial formation stage. However, even the deep vacuum of intergalactic space is not devoid of matter, as it contains a few hydrogen atoms per cubic meter. By comparison, the air humans breathe contains about 1025 molecules per cubic meter. The low density of matter in outer space means that electromagnetic radiation can travel great distances without being scattered: the mean free path of a photon in intergalactic space is about 1023 km, or 10 billion light years. In spite of this, extinction, which is the absorption and scattering of photons by dust and gas, is an important factor in galactic and intergalactic astronomy.Stars, planets, and moons retain their atmospheres by gravitational attraction. Atmospheres have no clearly delineated upper boundary: the density of atmospheric gas gradually decreases with distance from the object until it becomes indistinguishable from outer space. The Earth\'s atmospheric pressure drops to about 0.032 Pa at 100 kilometres (62 miles) of altitude, compared to 100,000 Pa for the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) definition of standard pressure. Above this altitude, isotropic gas pressure rapidly becomes insignificant when compared to radiation pressure from the Sun and the dynamic pressure of the solar wind. The thermosphere in this range has large gradients of pressure, temperature and composition, and varies greatly due to space weather.The temperature of outer space is measured in terms of the kinetic activity of the gas, as it is on Earth. However, the radiation of outer space has a different temperature than the kinetic temperature of the gas, meaning that the gas and radiation are not in thermodynamic equilibrium. All of the observable universe is filled with photons that were created during the Big Bang, which is known as the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB). (There is quite likely a correspondingly large number of neutrinos called the cosmic neutrino background.) The current black body temperature of the background radiation is about 3 K (−270 °C; −454 °F). The gas temperatures in outer space are always at least the temperature of the CMB but can be much higher. For example, the corona of the Sun reaches temperatures over 1.2–2.6 million K.Magnetic fields have been detected in the space around just about every class of celestial object. Star formation in spiral galaxies can generate small-scale dynamos, creating turbulent magnetic field strengths of around 5–10 μG. The Davis–Greenstein effect causes elongated dust grains to align themselves with a galaxy\'s magnetic field, resulting in weak optical polarization. This has been used to show ordered magnetic fields exist in several nearby galaxies. Magneto-hydrodynamic processes in active elliptical galaxies produce their characteristic jets and radio lobes. Non-thermal radio sources have been detected even among the most distant, high-z sources, indicating the presence of magnetic fields.Outside a protective atmosphere and magnetic field, there are few obstacles to the passage through space of energetic subatomic particles known as cosmic rays. These particles have energies ranging from about 106 eV up to an extreme 1020 eV of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays. The peak flux of cosmic rays occurs at energies of about 109 eV, with approximately 87% protons, 12% helium nuclei and 1% heavier nuclei. In the high energy range, the flux of electrons is only about 1% of that of protons. Cosmic rays can damage electronic components and pose a health threat to space travelers. According to astronauts, like Don Pettit, space has a burned/metallic odor that clings to their suits and equipment, similar to the scent of an arc welding torch.Despite the harsh environment, several life forms have been found that can withstand extreme space conditions for extended periods. Species of lichen carried on the ESA BIOPAN facility survived exposure for ten days in 2007. Seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana and Nicotiana tabacum germinated after being exposed to space for 1.5 years. A strain of bacillus subtilis has survived 559 days when exposed to low-Earth orbit or a simulated martian environment. The lithopanspermia hypothesis suggests that rocks ejected into outer space from life-harboring planets may successfully transport life forms to another habitable world. A conjecture is that just such a scenario occurred early in the history of the Solar System, with potentially microorganism-bearing rocks being exchanged between Venus, Earth, and Mars.\n\n\n=== Effect on human bodies ===\n\nEven at relatively low altitudes in the Earth\'s atmosphere, conditions are hostile to the human body. The altitude where atmospheric pressure matches the vapor pressure of water at the temperature of the human body is called the Armstrong line, named after American physician Harry G. Armstrong. It is located at an altitude of around 19.14 km (11.89 mi). At or above the Armstrong line, fluids in the throat and lungs boil away. More specifically, exposed bodily liquids such as saliva, tears, and liquids in the lungs boil away. Hence, at this altitude, human survival requires a pressure suit, or a pressurized capsule.Once in space, sudden exposure of unprotected humans to very low pressure, such as during a rapid decompression, can cause pulmonary barotrauma—a rupture of the lungs, due to the large pressure differential between inside and outside the chest. Even if the subject\'s airway is fully open, the flow of air through the windpipe may be too slow to prevent the rupture. Rapid decompression can rupture eardrums and sinuses, bruising and blood seep can occur in soft tissues, and shock can cause an increase in oxygen consumption that leads to hypoxia.As a consequence of rapid decompression, oxygen dissolved in the blood empties into the lungs to try to equalize the partial pressure gradient. Once the deoxygenated blood arrives at the brain, humans lose consciousness after a few seconds and die of hypoxia within minutes. Blood and other body fluids boil when the pressure drops below 6.3 kPa, and this condition is called ebullism. The steam may bloat the body to twice its normal size and slow circulation, but tissues are elastic and porous enough to prevent rupture. Ebullism is slowed by the pressure containment of blood vessels, so some blood remains liquid. Swelling and ebullism can be reduced by containment in a pressure suit. The Crew Altitude Protection Suit (CAPS), a fitted elastic garment designed in the 1960s for astronauts, prevents ebullism at pressures as low as 2 kPa. Supplemental oxygen is needed at 8 km (5.0 mi) to provide enough oxygen for breathing and to prevent water loss, while above 20 km (12 mi) pressure suits are essential to prevent ebullism. Most space suits use around 30–39 kPa of pure oxygen, about the same as on the Earth\'s surface. This pressure is high enough to prevent ebullism, but evaporation of nitrogen dissolved in the blood could still cause decompression sickness and gas embolisms if not managed.Humans evolved for life in Earth gravity, and exposure to weightlessness has been shown to have deleterious effects on human health. Initially, more than 50% of astronauts experience space motion sickness. This can cause nausea and vomiting, vertigo, headaches, lethargy, and overall malaise. The duration of space sickness varies, but it typically lasts for 1–3 days, after which the body adjusts to the new environment. Longer-term exposure to weightlessness results in muscle atrophy and deterioration of the skeleton, or spaceflight osteopenia. These effects can be minimized through a regimen of exercise. Other effects include fluid redistribution, slowing of the cardiovascular system, decreased production of red blood cells, balance disorders, and a weakening of the immune system. Lesser symptoms include loss of body mass, nasal congestion, sleep disturbance, and puffiness of the face.For long-duration space travel, radiation can pose an acute health hazard.\nExposure to high-energy, ionizing cosmic rays can result in fatigue, nausea, vomiting, as well as damage to the immune system and changes to the white blood cell count. Over longer durations, symptoms include an increased risk of cancer, plus damage to the eyes, nervous system, lungs and the gastrointestinal tract. On a round-trip Mars mission lasting three years, a large fraction of the cells in an astronaut\'s body would be traversed and potentially damaged by high energy nuclei. The energy of such particles is significantly diminished by the shielding provided by the walls of a spacecraft and can be further diminished by water containers and other barriers. However, the impact of the cosmic rays upon the shielding produces additional radiation that can affect the crew. Further research is needed to assess the radiation hazards and determine suitable countermeasures.\n\n\n== Boundary ==\n\nThere is no clear boundary between Earth\'s atmosphere and space, as the density of the atmosphere gradually decreases as the altitude increases. There are several standard boundary designations, namely:\n\nThe Fédération Aéronautique Internationale has established the Kármán line at an altitude of 100 km (62 mi) as a working definition for the boundary between aeronautics and astronautics. This is used because at an altitude of about 100 km (62 mi), as Theodore von Kármán calculated, a vehicle would have to travel faster than orbital velocity to derive sufficient aerodynamic lift from the atmosphere to support itself.\nThe United States designates people who travel above an altitude of 50 miles (80 km) as astronauts.\nNASA\'s Space Shuttle used 400,000 feet (76 mi, 122 km) as its re-entry altitude (termed the Entry Interface), which roughly marks the boundary where atmospheric drag becomes noticeable, thus beginning the process of switching from steering with thrusters to maneuvering with aerodynamic control surfaces.In 2009, scientists reported detailed measurements with a Supra-Thermal Ion Imager (an instrument that measures the direction and speed of ions), which allowed them to establish a boundary at 118 km (73 mi) above Earth. The boundary represents the midpoint of a gradual transition over tens of kilometers from the relatively gentle winds of the Earth\'s atmosphere to the more violent flows of charged particles in space, which can reach speeds well over 268 m/s (600 mph).\n\n\n== Legal status ==\n\nThe Outer Space Treaty provides the basic framework for international space law. It covers the legal use of outer space by nation states, and includes in its definition of outer space the Moon and other celestial bodies. The treaty states that outer space is free for all nation states to explore and is not subject to claims of national sovereignty. It also prohibits the deployment of nuclear weapons in outer space. The treaty was passed by the United Nations General Assembly in 1963 and signed in 1967 by the USSR, the United States of America and the United Kingdom. As of 2017, 105 state parties have either ratified or acceded to the treaty. An additional 25 states signed the treaty, without ratifying it.Since 1958, outer space has been the subject of multiple United Nations resolutions. Of these, more than 50 have been concerning the international co-operation in the peaceful uses of outer space and preventing an arms race in space. Four additional space law treaties have been negotiated and drafted by the UN\'s Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space. Still, there remains no legal prohibition against deploying conventional weapons in space, and anti-satellite weapons have been successfully tested by the US, USSR and China. The 1979 Moon Treaty turned the jurisdiction of all heavenly bodies (including the orbits around such bodies) over to the international community. However, this treaty has not been ratified by any nation that currently practices manned spaceflight.In 1976, eight equatorial states (Ecuador, Colombia, Brazil, Congo, Zaire, Uganda, Kenya, and Indonesia) met in Bogotá, Colombia. With their \"Declaration of the First Meeting of Equatorial Countries\", or \"the Bogotá Declaration\", they claimed control of the segment of the geosynchronous orbital path corresponding to each country. These claims are not internationally accepted.\n\n\n== Earth orbit ==\nA spacecraft enters orbit when its centripetal acceleration due to gravity is less than or equal to the centrifugal acceleration due to the horizontal component of its velocity. For a low Earth orbit, this velocity is about 7,800 m/s (28,100 km/h; 17,400 mph); by contrast, the fastest manned airplane speed ever achieved (excluding speeds achieved by deorbiting spacecraft) was 2,200 m/s (7,900 km/h; 4,900 mph) in 1967 by the North American X-15.To achieve an orbit, a spacecraft must travel faster than a sub-orbital spaceflight. The energy required to reach Earth orbital velocity at an altitude of 600 km (370 mi) is about 36 MJ/kg, which is six times the energy needed merely to climb to the corresponding altitude. Spacecraft with a perigee below about 2,000 km (1,200 mi) are subject to drag from the Earth\'s atmosphere, which decreases the orbital altitude. The rate of orbital decay depends on the satellite\'s cross-sectional area and mass, as well as variations in the air density of the upper atmosphere. Below about 300 km (190 mi), decay becomes more rapid with lifetimes measured in days. Once a satellite descends to 180 km (110 mi), it has only hours before it vaporizes in the atmosphere. The escape velocity required to pull free of Earth\'s gravitational field altogether and move into interplanetary space is about 11,200 m/s (40,300 km/h; 25,100 mph).\n\n\n== Regions ==\nSpace is a partial vacuum: its different regions are defined by the various atmospheres and \"winds\" that dominate within them, and extend to the point at which those winds give way to those beyond. Geospace extends from Earth\'s atmosphere to the outer reaches of Earth\'s magnetic field, whereupon it gives way to the solar wind of interplanetary space. Interplanetary space extends to the heliopause, whereupon the solar wind gives way to the winds of the interstellar medium. Interstellar space then continues to the edges of the galaxy, where it fades into the intergalactic void.\n\n\n=== Geospace ===\n\nGeospace is the region of outer space near Earth, including the upper atmosphere and magnetosphere. The Van Allen radiation belts lie within the geospace. The outer boundary of geospace is the magnetopause, which forms an interface between the Earth\'s magnetosphere and the solar wind. The inner boundary is the ionosphere. The variable space-weather conditions of geospace are affected by the behavior of the Sun and the solar wind; the subject of geospace is interlinked with heliophysics—the study of the Sun and its impact on the planets of the Solar System.The day-side magnetopause is compressed by solar-wind pressure—the subsolar distance from the center of the Earth is typically 10 Earth radii. On the night side, the solar wind stretches the magnetosphere to form a magnetotail that sometimes extends out to more than 100–200 Earth radii. For roughly four days of each month, the lunar surface is shielded from the solar wind as the Moon passes through the magnetotail.Geospace is populated by electrically charged particles at very low densities, the motions of which are controlled by the Earth\'s magnetic field. These plasmas form a medium from which storm-like disturbances powered by the solar wind can drive electrical currents into the Earth\'s upper atmosphere. Geomagnetic storms can disturb two regions of geospace, the radiation belts and the ionosphere. These storms increase fluxes of energetic electrons that can permanently damage satellite electronics, interfering with shortwave radio communication and GPS location and timing. Magnetic storms can also be a hazard to astronauts, even in low Earth orbit. They also create aurorae seen at high latitudes in an oval surrounding the geomagnetic poles.Although it meets the definition of outer space, the atmospheric density within the first few hundred kilometers above the Kármán line is still sufficient to produce significant drag on satellites. This region contains material left over from previous manned and unmanned launches that are a potential hazard to spacecraft. Some of this debris re-enters Earth\'s atmosphere periodically.\n\n\n==== Cislunar space ====\n\nEarth\'s gravity keeps the Moon in orbit at an average distance of 384,403 km (238,857 mi). The region outside Earth\'s atmosphere and extending out to just beyond the Moon\'s orbit, including the Lagrangian points, is sometimes referred to as cislunar space.The region of space where Earth\'s gravity remains dominant against gravitational perturbations from the Sun is called the Hill sphere. This extends well out into translunar space to a distance of roughly 1% of the mean distance from Earth to the Sun, or 1.5 million km (0.93 million mi).\nDeep space has different definitions as to where it starts. It has been defined by the United States government and others as any region beyond cislunar space. The International Telecommunication Union responsible for radio communication (including satellites) defines the beginning of deep space at about 5 times that distance (2×106 km).\n\n\n=== Interplanetary space ===\n\nInterplanetary space is defined by the solar wind, a continuous stream of charged particles emanating from the Sun that creates a very tenuous atmosphere (the heliosphere) for billions of kilometers into space. This wind has a particle density of 5–10 protons/cm3 and is moving at a velocity of 350–400 km/s (780,000–890,000 mph). Interplanetary space extends out to the heliopause where the influence of the galactic environment starts to dominate over the magnetic field and particle flux from the Sun. The distance and strength of the heliopause varies depending on the activity level of the solar wind.The volume of interplanetary space is a nearly total vacuum, with a mean free path of about one astronomical unit at the orbital distance of the Earth. However, this space is not completely empty, and is sparsely filled with cosmic rays, which include ionized atomic nuclei and various subatomic particles. There is also gas, plasma and dust, small meteors, and several dozen types of organic molecules discovered to date by microwave spectroscopy. A cloud of interplanetary dust is visible at night as a faint band called the zodiacal light.Interplanetary space contains the magnetic field generated by the Sun. There are also magnetospheres generated by planets such as Jupiter, Saturn, Mercury and the Earth that have their own magnetic fields. These are shaped by the influence of the solar wind into the approximation of a teardrop shape, with the long tail extending outward behind the planet. These magnetic fields can trap particles from the solar wind and other sources, creating belts of charged particles such as the Van Allen radiation belts. Planets without magnetic fields, such as Mars, have their atmospheres gradually eroded by the solar wind.\n\n\n=== Interstellar space ===\n\nInterstellar space is the physical space within a galaxy beyond the influence each star has upon the encompassed plasma. The contents of interstellar space are called the interstellar medium. Approximately 70% of the mass of the interstellar medium consists of lone hydrogen atoms; most of the remainder consists of helium atoms. This is enriched with trace amounts of heavier atoms formed through stellar nucleosynthesis. These atoms are ejected into the interstellar medium by stellar winds or when evolved stars begin to shed their outer envelopes such as during the formation of a planetary nebula. The cataclysmic explosion of a supernova generates an expanding shock wave consisting of ejected materials that further enrich the medium. The density of matter in the interstellar medium can vary considerably: the average is around 106 particles per m3, but cold molecular clouds can hold 108–1012 per m3.A number of molecules exist in interstellar space, as can tiny 0.1 μm dust particles. The tally of molecules discovered through radio astronomy is steadily increasing at the rate of about four new species per year. Large regions of higher density matter known as molecular clouds allow chemical reactions to occur, including the formation of organic polyatomic species. Much of this chemistry is driven by collisions. Energetic cosmic rays penetrate the cold, dense clouds and ionize hydrogen and helium, resulting, for example, in the trihydrogen cation. An ionized helium atom can then split relatively abundant carbon monoxide to produce ionized carbon, which in turn can lead to organic chemical reactions.The local interstellar medium is a region of space within 100 parsecs (pc) of the Sun, which is of interest both for its proximity and for its interaction with the Solar System. This volume nearly coincides with a region of space known as the Local Bubble, which is characterized by a lack of dense, cold clouds. It forms a cavity in the Orion Arm of the Milky Way galaxy, with dense molecular clouds lying along the borders, such as those in the constellations of Ophiuchus and Taurus. (The actual distance to the border of this cavity varies from 60 to 250 pc or more.) This volume contains about 104–105 stars and the local interstellar gas counterbalances the astrospheres that surround these stars, with the volume of each sphere varying depending on the local density of the interstellar medium. The Local Bubble contains dozens of warm interstellar clouds with temperatures of up to 7,000 K and radii of 0.5–5 pc.When stars are moving at sufficiently high peculiar velocities, their astrospheres can generate bow shocks as they collide with the interstellar medium. For decades it was assumed that the Sun had a bow shock. In 2012, data from Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) and NASA\'s Voyager probes showed that the Sun\'s bow shock does not exist. Instead, these authors argue that a subsonic bow wave defines the transition from the solar wind flow to the interstellar medium. A bow shock is the third boundary of an astrosphere after the termination shock and the astropause (called the heliopause in the Solar System).\n\n\n=== Intergalactic space ===\n\nIntergalactic space is the physical space between galaxies. Studies of the large scale distribution of galaxies show that the Universe has a foam-like structure, with clusters and groups of galaxies lying along filaments that occupy about a tenth of the total space. The remainder forms huge voids that are mostly empty of galaxies. Typically, a void spans a distance of (10–40) h−1 Mpc, where h is the Hubble constant in units of 100 km s−1 Mpc−1.Surrounding and stretching between galaxies, there is a rarefied plasma that is organized in a galactic filamentary structure. This material is called the intergalactic medium (IGM). The density of the IGM is 5–200 times the average density of the Universe. It consists mostly of ionized hydrogen; i.e. a plasma consisting of equal numbers of electrons and protons. As gas falls into the intergalactic medium from the voids, it heats up to temperatures of 105 K to 107 K, which is high enough so that collisions between atoms have enough energy to cause the bound electrons to escape from the hydrogen nuclei; this is why the IGM is ionized. At these temperatures, it is called the warm–hot intergalactic medium (WHIM). (Although the plasma is very hot by terrestrial standards, 105 K is often called \"warm\" in astrophysics.) Computer simulations and observations indicate that up to half of the atomic matter in the Universe might exist in this warm–hot, rarefied state. When gas falls from the filamentary structures of the WHIM into the galaxy clusters at the intersections of the cosmic filaments, it can heat up even more, reaching temperatures of 108 K and above in the so-called intracluster medium.\n\n\n== Exploration and applications ==\n\nFor the majority of human history, space was explored by observations made from the Earth\'s surface—initially with the unaided eye and then with the telescope. Prior to the advent of reliable rocket technology, the closest that humans had come to reaching outer space was through the use of balloon flights. In 1935, the U.S. Explorer II manned balloon flight had reached an altitude of 22 km (14 mi). This was greatly exceeded in 1942 when the third launch of the German A-4 rocket climbed to an altitude of about 80 km (50 mi). In 1957, the unmanned satellite Sputnik 1 was launched by a Russian R-7 rocket, achieving Earth orbit at an altitude of 215–939 kilometres (134–583 mi). This was followed by the first human spaceflight in 1961, when Yuri Gagarin was sent into orbit on Vostok 1. The first humans to escape low-Earth orbit were Frank Borman, Jim Lovell and William Anders in 1968 on board the U.S. Apollo 8, which achieved lunar orbit and reached a maximum distance of 377,349 km (234,474 mi) from the Earth.The first spacecraft to reach escape velocity was the Soviet Luna 1, which performed a fly-by of the Moon in 1959. In 1961, Venera 1 became the first planetary probe. It revealed the presence of the solar wind and performed the first fly-by of Venus, although contact was lost before reaching Venus. The first successful planetary mission was the 1962 fly-by of Venus by Mariner 2. The first fly-by of Mars was by Mariner 4 in 1964. Since that time, unmanned spacecraft have successfully examined each of the Solar System\'s planets, as well their moons and many minor planets and comets. They remain a fundamental tool for the exploration of outer space, as well as observation of the Earth. In August 2012, Voyager 1 became the first man-made object to leave the Solar System and enter interstellar space.The absence of air makes outer space an ideal location for astronomy at all wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum. This is evidenced by the spectacular pictures sent back by the Hubble Space Telescope, allowing light from more than 13 billion years ago—almost to the time of the Big Bang—to be observed. However, not every location in space is ideal for a telescope. The interplanetary zodiacal dust emits a diffuse near-infrared radiation that can mask the emission of faint sources such as extrasolar planets. Moving an infrared telescope out past the dust increases its effectiveness. Likewise, a site like the Daedalus crater on the far side of the Moon could shield a radio telescope from the radio frequency interference that hampers Earth-based observations.Unmanned spacecraft in Earth orbit are an essential technology of modern civilization. They allow direct monitoring of weather conditions, relay long-range communications like television, provide a means of precise navigation, and allow remote sensing of the Earth. The latter role serves a wide variety of purposes, including tracking soil moisture for agriculture, prediction of water outflow from seasonal snow packs, detection of diseases in plants and trees, and surveillance of military activities.The deep vacuum of space could make it an attractive environment for certain industrial processes, such as those requiring ultraclean surfaces. However, like asteroid mining, space manufacturing requires significant investment with little prospect of immediate return. An important factor in the total expense is the high cost of placing mass into Earth orbit: $7,000–25,000 per kg in inflation-adjusted dollars, according to a 2006 estimate. Proposed concepts for addressing this issue include non-rocket spacelaunch, momentum exchange tethers, and space elevators.Interstellar travel for a human crew remains at present only a theoretical possibility. The distances to the nearest stars will require new technological developments and the ability to safely sustain crews for journeys lasting several decades. For example, the Daedalus Project study, which proposed a spacecraft powered by the fusion of Deuterium and He3, would require 36 years to reach the nearby Alpha Centauri system. Other proposed interstellar propulsion systems include light sails, ramjets, and beam-powered propulsion. More advanced propulsion systems could use antimatter as a fuel, potentially reaching relativistic velocities.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nNewscientist Space\nspace.com', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1f/52706main_hstorion_lg.jpg'),
(118, 'List of UFO religions', 'UFO religions are groups which deal with alleged communication between humans and extraterrestrial beings. Forms of communication include telepathy and astral projection. Groups often believe that humanity can be saved after being educated by the aliens as to how to improve society. Alien abduction belief can lead to formation of a UFO religion. I AM Religious Activity, founded in 1930 by Guy Ballard, is seen, according to one author, as the first UFO Religion, though Aetherius Society founded by George King has also been given this distinction. Scholars identify the 1947 Roswell UFO Incident as a key event within the history of UFO spirituality. Melodie Campbell and Stephen A. Kent describe Heaven\'s Gate and Order of the Solar Temple as among the most controversial of the UFO belief groups. Scientology is seen by scholars as a UFO religion, due to its Xenu cosmogony and the presence of Space opera in Scientology doctrine.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nUFO religions generally deal with belief in communication with extraterrestrial beings. Stephen Hunt writes in Alternative Religions: A Sociological Introduction, \"One form of quasi-religion that perhaps borders on a more orthodox form of religiosity is that of the flying saucer cults\". In these groups, individuals believe that communication between aliens and humans can take the form of physical contact, telepathy, and astral projection. Typically the groups believe that humanity will be saved by these aliens when humans are educated as to a better way to live life. Some of the groups believe that aliens will come to take those that believe to a more positive location. Often the extraterrestrial beings are seen to plead with humanity to improve itself and to move away from a society of greed and violence. UFO religions place an emphasis on spiritual growth and the evolution of humanity. A UFO religion can be formed before or after an individual claims to have experienced an alien abduction and been taken aboard a spacecraft.Christopher Hugh Partridge writes in UFO Religions that J. Gordon Melton identifies the first UFO religion as the group \"I AM\" Activity, founded by Guy Ballard. Partridge says it \"can be seen as the obvious theosophical forerunner to UFO religions such as the Aetherius Society, and to the thought of UFO religionists such as George Adamski\" but views it not as a UFO religion but as a theosophical religion.Partridge notes that within UFO religions, there is a belief that the supreme being or \"evolved entity\" did not ascend from Earth, but instead came from another plane or another planet and descended to Earth. While the vast majority of factions affiliated with I AM reject UFOs as unimportant, some modern-day Ascended Master Teachings teachers such as Joshua David Stone mention UFOs.\nPartridge describes the 1947 Roswell UFO Incident as a key point in time within UFO spirituality, commenting: \"Roswell is now firmly established as what might be described as a key ufological \'spiritual site\' \"; and James R. Lewis also calls attention to this event in his book The Gods Have Landed, noting that it is seen by Ufologists as the date of the \"emergence of UFOs into the public consciousness\". Partridge places UFO religion within the context of theosophical esotericism, and asserts that it began to be associated as \"UFO religion\" after the 1947 incident at Roswell, New Mexico. According to Partridge, most UFO religions still have many of the key points associated with Theosophy, such as belief in the same Spiritual Hierarchy, and he also draws parallels to New Age thought. He notes that within the thought processes of UFO religions after 1947, many of these groups maintained beliefs that extraterrestrial beings were \"heralds of a new era\".Hunt describes the Aetherius Society founded by George King in 1955 as \"probably the first and certainly the most enduring UFO cult\". He places the Aetherius Society and Raëlism among the \"most renowned\" of the \"flying saucer cults\". Writing in the Encyclopedia of Religion and Society, contributors Melodie Campbell and Stephen A. Kent place the Aetherius Society and Unarius as among the \"oldest and most studied\" of the flying saucer cults. They describe groups Heaven\'s Gate and Order of the Solar Temple as the \"most controversial groups combining UFO belief with variations of contactee assertions\". Gregory L. Reece classes Scientology as a \"UFO group\" in his book UFO Religion: Inside Flying Saucer Cults and Culture, and discusses elements of the Xenu cosmogony and Space opera in Scientology doctrine. He compares Scientology to the Aetherius Society and to Ashtar Command, writing: \"While it bears strong similarities to the Ashtar Command or the Aetherius Society, its emphasis upon the Xenu event as the central message of the group seems to place them within the ancient astronaut tradition. Either way, Scientology is perhaps most different from other UFO groups in their attempt to keep all of the space opera stuff under wraps.\" A similar comparison is made in New Religions: A Guide, which describes the Xenu mythology as \"a basic ancient astronaut myth\". Author Victoria Nelson writes in The Secret Life of Puppets that \"[t]he most prominent current UFO religion is probably the science fiction writer L. Ron Hubbard\'s Church of Scientology\".\n\n\n== List ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nDoomsday cult\nList of new religious movements\nList of Ufologists\nList of UFO organizations\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nBainbridge, William Sims (1996).

(119, 'Alien abduction entities', 'Alien abduction entities are the beings alleged to secretly abduct and subject experiencers to a forced medical examination which often emphasizes their reproductive system. Mainstream scientists and mental health professionals overwhelmingly doubt that the phenomenon occurs literally as reported and instead attribute the experiences to \"deception, suggestibility (fantasy-proneness, hypnotizability, false-memory syndrome), personality, sleep phenomena, psychopathology, psychodynamics [and] environmental factors.\" Skeptic Robert Sheaffer also sees similarity between the aliens depicted in early science fiction films, in particular, Invaders From Mars, and those reported to have actually abducted people. The first alien abduction claim to be widely publicized was the Betty and Barney Hill abduction in 1961, which featured diminutive, large-eyed beings who wore military-style uniforms.\n\n\n== Alleged motivations ==\nExperiencers sometimes claim to have been given information regarding the motivations and goals underlying the bizarre procedures of the abduction event by their alleged abductors. Dr. John G. Miller says that in the cases he\'s studied, abductees report that when they ask their captors why the invasive and humiliating medical procedures are being performed on them, the entity will often express sentiments like \"We have the right to do this.\"Author and UFOlogist Jenny Randles conducted a study focused on the motivations given by the abductors for the abduction phenomenon to alleged experiencers. Her study sampled about 50 abduction claims and found that in about 60% of the alleged cases, the abductors had offered the experiencer insight into their motivations for performing the abduction. She found that similar motivations were reported by abduction claimants irrespective of whether or not memories of the event were assisted by hypnosis.Randles says that the reported motivation formed a loose narrative centered on long term surveillance and interaction. The entities target certain individuals for some unique quality and abduct them repeatedly. During the abductions information is supposedly being subconsciously implanted to be \"activated\" by the entities at some later time. This time is sometimes claimed to correspond to some major change on earth that the entities desire to assist us in dealing with. She notes that different types of reported entities are said to have differing motivations, with the \"Nordic\" type being more benevolent than the \"Grays.\"\n\n\n== Types ==\nSometimes a single abduction claim will report multiple types of entities appearing to work together cooperatively.\n\n\n== Reported technology ==\n\n\n=== Weapon ===\nAccording to Nick Pope\'s book The Uninvited, the grey aliens use a device that is black, cylindrical, is the size of a US Number 2 pencil, has a bluish light on one end. It is used as a weapon on combative abductees to make them more compliant, by numbing the will. It looks like a Star Trek \"phaser\" being fired, only that a bluish-white beam is being fired at the combative abductee.\n\n\n=== Medical ===\nLinda Moulton Howe reported on a pencil-sized cylindrical device with a light on one end that has been independently reported in at least two alleged abductions. The device is apparently used in a manner analogous to a surgical scalpel by the alleged abductors. One alleged abductee claimed that when the device was used, the chest opened bloodlessly in \"slow motion,\" and compared it to watching a flower blossom in time lapse photography. The claimant further described the device as \"opening the body with sound.\"\n\n\n== Plausibility and veracity ==\n\n\n=== Hypnosis as an influence on abductor descriptions ===\nRegarding the various types of reported abducting beings, folklorist and abduction researcher Thomas E. Bullard says \"The small showing for monstrous types and the fact that they concentrate in less reliable cases should disappoint skeptics who look for the origin of abductions in the influence of Hollywood. Nothing like the profusion of imaginative screen aliens appears in the abduction literature.\"Bullard, in something of a concession to skeptics, has noted that the presence or absence of hypnosis as a method for memory retrieval in abduction claimants seems to affect descriptions of the abductors themselves. Hypnotically-assisted recall is more likely to produce descriptions of the \"standard\" Grey humanoid while cases where hypnosis was not used \"include more variety.\" However, rather than take a firmly skeptical position based on this observation, Bullard says \"Whether hypnosis shapes and implants memories, or breaks through a surface screen memory to reveal the true appearance of the beings, remains a question in need of resolution.\"\n\n\n=== Geography and culture as influences on abductor descriptions ===\nAlthough proponents have argued that there is a core narrative consistent across abduction claims, there is little doubt that variation occurs in the details of reports across cultures and geographic boundaries. The biology and attitudes of the abductors are points of drastic divergence between the home countries of different abduction claimants. Robert Sheaffer observes:\n\n\"In North America large-headed gray aliens predominate, while in Britain abduction aliens are usually tall, blond, and Nordic, and South America tends toward more bizarre creatures, including hairy monsters.\"\n\nAs noted above, the so-called grey aliens are most popularly associated with abduction reports. Again, however, this seems to be a North American paradigm best-known since the 1980s. On the contrary, some researchers (such as Kevin D. Randle in his 1997 book, Faces Of The Visitors: An Illustrated Reference To Alien Contact) have noted a vast variety of alleged creatures have been reported in abduction accounts worldwide, with some of the alleged creatures not even described as humanoid.\nAlthough in North America, \"aliens\" of extraterrestrial origin are the most commonly blamed in these incidents, in Europe and other parts of the world, the beings involved are as often perceived to be demonic or spiritual in origin. Common elements in the descriptions of abductions and visitations vary by region and local culture, with only a very few elements being the same worldwide, such as an otherworldly sensation, reports of mind control, repressed memories being rediscovered, and sexual experiences. These elements, and many aspects of what witnesses describe, are very common in old stories of encounters with faeries, demons, and other magical creatures.\nIn Brazil, there are strong links between the abduction phenomenon and spiritist traditions. Brazilian abduction researcher Gilda Moura reports that following an increase in spiritism in the 1980s, there was a surge in the popularity of \"Spiritist Centers\" where paranormal healings occurred that \"involv[ed] actual surgical cutting\".These kinds of centers first appeared in the 1950s where claims of medical practitioners operating out \"of a space laboratory\" spread among the Brazilian population, especially among the spiritist community. Descriptions of these alleged healing experiences share much common imagery with the alien abduction and medical examinations reported in the anglophone world. Moura notes that the critical difference between Brazilian reports of spiritual space surgeons and \"typical\" abductions is that Brazilians perceive the phenomenon as \"pleasant and spiritual\" while abductees report \"terror.\"\n\n\n==== Science fiction as an influence ====\nSheaffer also sees similarity between the aliens depicted in early science fiction films, in particular, Invaders From Mars, and those reported to have actually abducted people. Commonalities exist in the appearances, behavior, technology and societies of fictional and allegedly real abductors. Furthermore, the contents and structure of the \"abduction narrative\" as outlined by researchers like Nyman and Bullard was already established in fictional form by 1930 in a Buck Rogers strip.However, Bullard does not see evidence for influence on abduction claimants from science fiction sources.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAlien abduction\nAlien abduction claimants\n\n\n== References ==', ''),
(120, 'Berwyn Mountain UFO incident', 'On 23 January 1974 on the Berwyn Mountains in Llandrillo, Merionethshire, Wales, lights and noises were observed that were alleged to be related to a UFO sighting on Cadair Berwyn and Cadair Bronwen. Scientific evidence indicates that the event was generated by an earthquake combined with sightings of a bright meteor widely observed over Wales and northern England at the time.\n\n\n== History ==\nOn the evening of 23 January 1974, residents of the Berwyn Mountains area in northern Wales reported a loud noise and a bright light in the sky. When UFOlogists claimed that a UFO crashed and the British Government covered up the military\'s recovery of a crashed spaceship, some tabloid newspapers jokingly labelled it \"The Roswelsh Incident\".Scientific evidence indicates the event was generated by an earthquake combined with sightings of a bright meteor widely observed over Wales and Northern England at the time.Declassified Ministry of Defence documents suggest the incident was caused by the combined effects of an earthquake and a meteor. The Institute of Geological Sciences (now British Geological Survey) reported that a magnitude 3.5 earthquake was felt at 8:38 p.m. that night over a wide area of northern Wales and as far as Liverpool, England (also in Formby 13 miles north of Liverpool). It was not immediately identified for what it was, hence the police investigation. However, the magnitude of the shock was such that had it been due to impact, the resulting crater would have been large enough to be easily visible. The unusual lights reported may have been simply the meteor, but may also have included the phenomenon known as earthquake light.\n\n\n== Popular culture ==\nOn the TV show Ancient Aliens, former Ministry of Defence UFO investigator Nick Pope claimed wreckage from a UFO crash was likely taken to RAF Rudloe Manor.\n\n\n== See also ==\nUFO sightings in the United Kingdom\n\n\n== References ==', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d7/Blue_pog.svg'),
(121, 'Mantell UFO Incident', 'On January 7, 1948, 25-year-old Captain Thomas F. Mantell, a Kentucky Air National Guard pilot, died in the crash of his P-51 Mustang fighter, after being sent in pursuit of an unidentified flying object (UFO). The event  was among the most publicized early UFO incidents.\nLater investigation by the United States Air Force\'s Project Blue Book indicated that Mantell may have died chasing a Skyhook balloon, which in 1948 was a top-secret project that Mantell would not have known about. Mantell pursued the object in a steep climb, and disregarded suggestions to level his altitude. At high altitude he blacked out from a lack of oxygen. His relative inexperience with the P-51 may have been a contributing factor.\nHistorian David M. Jacobs argues the Mantell case marked a sharp shift in both public and governmental perceptions of UFOs. Previously, the news media often treated UFO reports with a whimsical or glib attitude reserved for “silly season news”. Following Mantell\'s death, however, Jacobs notes \"the fact that a person had died in an encounter with an alleged flying saucer dramatically increased public concern about the phenomenon. Now a dramatic new prospect entered thought about UFOs: they might be not only extraterrestrial but potentially hostile as well.\"\n\n\n== Incident ==\n\nMantell was an experienced pilot; his flight history consisted of 2,167 hours in the air, and he had been honored for his part in the Battle of Normandy during World War II.On 7 January 1948, Godman Army Airfield at Fort Knox, Kentucky, received a report from the Kentucky Highway Patrol of an unusual aerial object near Madisonville, Kentucky. Reports of a westbound circular object, 250–300 feet (80–90 m) in diameter, were received from Owensboro and Irvington.At about 1:45 p.m., Sergeant Quinton Blackwell saw an object from his position in the control tower at Fort Knox. Two other witnesses in the tower also reported a white object in the distance. Colonel Guy Hix, the base commander, reported an object he described as \"very white,\" and \"about one fourth the size of the full moon ... Through binoculars it appeared to have a red border at the bottom ... It remained stationary, seemingly, for one and a half hours.\"  Observers at Clinton County Army Air Field in Ohio described the object \"as having the appearance of a flaming red cone trailing a gaseous green mist\" and observed the object for around 35 minutes.  Another observer at Lockbourne Army Air Field in Ohio noted, \"Just before leaving it came to very near the ground, staying down for about ten seconds, then climbed at a very fast rate back to its original altitude, 10,000 feet, leveling off and disappearing into the overcast heading 120 degrees. Its speed was greater than 500 mph (800 km/h) in level flight.\"Four F-51D Mustangs of C Flight, 165th Fighter Squadron Kentucky Air National Guard—one piloted by Mantell—were already in the air and told to approach the object. Blackwell was in radio communication with the pilots throughout the event.\nOne pilot\'s Mustang was low on fuel, and he quickly returned to base. Air Force Captain Edward J. Ruppelt (the first head of Project Blue Book) notes that there was some disagreement amongst the air traffic controllers as to Mantell\'s words as he communicated with the tower: some sources reported that Mantell had described an object \"[which] looks metallic and of tremendous size,\" but according to Ruppelt, others disputed whether or not Mantell actually said this.The other two pilots accompanied Mantell in steep pursuit of the object. They later reported they saw an object, but described it as so small and indistinct that they could not identify it. Mantell ignored suggestions that the pilots should level their altitude and try to more clearly see the object.Only one of Mantell\'s wingmen, Lt. Albert Clements, had an oxygen mask, and his oxygen was in low supply. Clements and the third pilot, Lt. Hammond, called off their pursuit at 22,500 feet (6,900 m). Mantell continued to climb, however. According to the Air Force, once Mantell passed 25,000 feet (7,600 m) he blacked out from the lack of oxygen (hypoxia), and his plane began spiraling back towards the ground. A witness later reported Mantell\'s Mustang in a circling descent. His plane crashed on a farm south of Franklin, Kentucky, on the Kentucky–Tennessee state line.Firemen later pulled Mantell\'s body from the Mustang\'s wreckage. His seat belt was shredded, and his wristwatch had stopped at 3:18 p.m., the time of his crash. Meanwhile, by 3:50 p.m. the UFO was no longer visible to observers at Godman Army Airfield. The Mantell incident was reported by newspapers around the nation, and received significant news media attention. A number of sensational rumors were also circulated about Mantell\'s crash. According to UFO historian Curtis Peebles, among the rumors were claims that \"the flying saucer was a Soviet missile; it was [an alien] spacecraft that shot down [Mantell\'s fighter] when it got too close; Captain Mantell\'s body was found riddled with bullets; the body was missing; the plane had completely disintegrated in the air; [and] the wreckage was radioactive.\" However, no evidence has ever surfaced to substantiate any of these claims, and Air Force investigation specifically refuted some claims, such as the supposedly radioactive wreckage. Captain Ruppelt wrote that \"I had always heard a lot of wild speculation about the condition of Mantell\'s crashed F-51, so I wired for a copy of the accident report. [It] said that...Mantell\'s body had not burned, not disintegrated, and was not full of holes; the wreck was not radioactive, nor was it magnetized.\" Mantell was the first member of the Kentucky Air National Guard to die in flight. According to John Trowbridge, historian of the Kentucky National Guard, \"There is a real X-Files twist to this, too. Mantell lived almost his entire life in Louisville, but he was born in a hospital in Franklin, only a few miles from where he was killed.\"In 1956, Ruppelt wrote that the Mantell crash was one of three \"classic\" UFO cases in 1948 that would help to define the UFO phenomenon in the public mind, and would help convince some Air Force intelligence specialists that UFOs were a \"real\", physical phenomenon.  The other two \"classic\" sightings in 1948 were the Chiles-Whitted UFO encounter and the Gorman dogfight.\n\n\n== Venus explanation and rejection ==\nThe Mantell crash was investigated by Project Sign, the first Air Force research group assigned to investigate UFO reports. One writer noted that \"The people on Project Sign worked fast on the Mantell Incident. Contemplating a flood of queries from the press as soon as they heard about the crash, they realized that they had to get a quick answer. Venus had been the target of a chase by an Air Force F-51 several weeks before and there were similarities between this sighting and the Mantell Incident. So...the word \'Venus\' went out. Mantell had unfortunately been killed trying to reach the planet Venus.\" An Air Force major who was interviewed by several reporters following Mantell\'s crash \"flatly stated that it was Venus.\"In 1952 USAF Captain Edward Ruppelt, the supervisor of Project Blue Book, Project Sign\'s successor, was ordered to reinvestigate the Mantell Incident. Ruppelt spoke with Dr. J. Allen Hynek, an astronomer at Ohio State University and scientific consultant to Project Sign and Project Blue Book. Hynek had supplied Project Sign with the Venus explanation in 1948, mainly because Venus had been in the same place in the sky that Mantell\'s UFO was observed. However, by 1952 Dr. Hynek had concluded that the Venus explanation was incorrect, because \"Venus wasn\'t bright enough to be seen\" by Mantell and the other witnesses, and because a considerable haze was present that would have further obscured the planet in the sky. Ruppelt also noted Dr. Hynek\'s statement that Venus, even if visible, would have been a \"pinpoint of light\", but that eyewitness \"descriptions plainly indicated a large object. None of the descriptions could even vaguely be called a pinpoint of light.\"\n\n\n== Skyhook balloon explanation ==\nHaving rejected the Venus explanation, Captain Ruppelt began to research other explanations for the incident. He was particularly interested in a suggestion by Dr. Hynek that Mantell could have misidentified a United States Navy Skyhook  weather balloon. In Madisonville, Kentucky \"the object was seen through a telescope [and] identified as a balloon by one observer.\" Additionally, between 4:30 and 4:45 PM an astronomer at Vanderbilt University \"watched an object in the sky...viewed through binoculars, he said it was a pear-shaped balloon with cables and a basket attached.\"However, others disputed this idea, noting that no particular Skyhook balloon could be conclusively identified as being in the area in question during Mantell\'s pursuit. Despite this objection, Ruppelt thought the Skyhook explanation was plausible: the balloons were a secret Navy project at the time of Mantell\'s crash, were made of reflective aluminum, and were about 100 feet (30 m) in diameter, consistent with the description of the UFO as large, metallic, and cone-shaped. Since the Skyhook balloons were secret at the time, neither Mantell nor the other observers in the air control tower would have been able to identify the UFO as a Skyhook. But this was never proved, as Ruppelt wrote:\n\"Somewhere in the archives of the Air Force or the Navy there are records that will show whether or not a balloon was launched from Clinton County AFB, Ohio, on January 7, 1948. I never could find these records. People who were working with the early skyhook projects \"remember\" operating out of Clinton County AFB in 1947 but refuse to be pinned down to a January 7 flight. Maybe, they said. The Mantell Incident is the same old UFO jigsaw puzzle.\"Project Skyhook was legally linked with General Mills, the cereal company, Jean Piccard, the French Balloonist, and Otto C. Winzen of Winzen Research.\n\n\n== Inexperience with the F-51 ==\nResearchers have also noted that while Mantell was an experienced pilot, he was rather new to the F-51, and that this relative inexperience could have been a factor in the crash. This does not, of course, account for the identity of the UFO.\n\n\n== Thomas Mantell biography ==\nCaptain Thomas Francis Mantell Jr. (30 June 1922 – 7 January 1948) was a United States Air Force officer and a World War II veteran. Mantell was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for courageous action during the Operation Market Garden, and an Air Medal with three Oak leaf clusters for aerial achievement.\n\n\n=== Career ===\nMantell graduated from Male High School in Louisville. On 16 June 1942, Mantell joined the United States Army Air Corps, finishing Flight School on 30 June 1943. During World War II, he was C-47 Skytrain pilot assigned to the 96th Troop Carrier Squadron, 440th Troop Carrier Group, which air dropped the 101st Airborne Division into Normandy, France on 6 June 1944 and participated in Operation Market Garden.  \nMantell, then a lieutenant, was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for heroism while flying over Holland on 18 September 1944 during Operation Market Garden.  He was the pilot of a cargo plane, named Vulture\'s  Delight, towing a glider, when it came under heavy anti-aircraft fire. All but one of the rudder and elevator controls were disabled, and the aircraft\'s tail was afire.  Mantell\'s crew chief fought the fire with live ammunition detonating. Rather than release the glider, Lt. Mantell decided to continue with his misson. The glider was released at the correct location, and Mantell returned to base.  Upon inspection, his aircraft was so damaged that it appeared to be unable to fly.   Mantell was nicknamed \"Shiny\" by his comrades. This was because of his \"constant well-scrubbed look.\"   Mantell was also described as \"able to think fast and act quickly.\" After the war, Mantell returned to Louisville, joining the newly formed Kentucky Air National Guard on 16 February 1947.  He became a F-51D Mustang pilot in the 165th Fighter Squadron.\nFollowing his death in January 1948, Mantell\'s remains were sent to Louisville for burial in the Zachary Taylor National Cemetery.\n\nOn 29 September 2001, the Simpson County Historical Society unveiled a historical marker in honor of Thomas Mantell in his hometown of Franklin. The marker is located at the exit off Interstate 65.\n\n\n=== Awards ===\nPilot Badge\nDistinguished Flying Cross\nAir Medal with three oak leaf clusters\nDistinguished Unit Citation\nAmerican Campaign Medal\nEuropean–African–Middle Eastern Campaign Medal with two campaign stars\nWorld War II Victory Medal\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nThe Mantell incident is one of the earliest UFO incidents to attract widespread public attention.  It is considered one of the \"classic\" UFO incidents from the late 1940s.\nThe Mantell incident was featured in the 1956 quasi-documentary Unidentified Flying Objects: The True Story of Flying Saucers.  The film helped spur public interest in UFOs and speculation that UFOs were of extraterrestrial origin.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of reported UFO sightings\nProject Mogul\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Additional references ===\n\n\n== External links ==\nUFO Casebook: The Death of Thomas Mantell (includes official documents)\n1948, The Death of Thomas Mantell, UFO Casebook Files\n1948-Death of Thomas Mantell:By Billy Booth, About.com', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/Capt._Mantell_Marker.jpg'),
(122, 'UFO sightings in South Africa', 'This is a list of alleged sightings of unidentified flying objects or UFOs in South Africa.\n\n\n== 1965 report ==\nAccording to NICAP and Flying Saucer Review magazine, after midnight on 16 September, police constables Lockem and de Klerk observed a shiny, copper-coloured craft which had landed astride the white middle line of the Pretoria–Bronkhorstspruit road, at a spot that was deserted 5 minutes earlier. Their patrol vehicle allegedly cut out as they watched the craft rapidly ascending, while emitting a sea of flames through two portals below. The 30 feet (9.1 m) wide disc, shaped like a spinning top, darted silently in a northwesterly direction, leaving the asphalt ablaze for many minutes afterwards. According to NICAP, the incident was confirmed in a press release by Lt colonel J. B. Brits, district commandant of Pretoria North, but scientists from the C.S.I.R. who were asked to investigate the 6 ft wide, buckled and charred imprint, ridiculed the saucer explanation. Constable Lockem, aided by a staff artist of Die Vaderland newspaper, provided a sketch of the craft. Residents of the East Rand reported an \"enormous white light\" and a \"red ball\" in their skies earlier that night.\n\n\n== 1970s sightings ==\nIn 1972, Bennie Smith, the owner of a farm near Fort Beaufort in the eastern Cape region of South Africa, says he fired shots at an unknown object hovering at treetop height after a worker named Boer de Klerk alerted him to it. Smith believed his shots were accurately aimed, but had no effect. Police sergeant Piet Kitching and police station commander Van Rensburg stated they arrived and fired shots at the object, described as metallic and shaped like a 44-gallon drum with three legs that changed colors before it flew away. They said they found imprints and markings on the ground they believed were made by the object. It is claimed that the Grahamstown army regiment investigated the site, but the base has no records of such an event. The incident received coverage by international press, and led to businesses capitalizing on the incident, with a tavern calling itself the \"UFO Bar\" and painting flying saucers on the walls and the local Savoy Hotel keeping clippings of the stories posted on its walls. In a humorous editorial, the New Scientist stated the apartheid South African government was \"very fastidious about the sort of immigrants she welcomes and little green men may very well be on the prohibited list\".\nOn the evening of 12 November 1972 four soldiers at the Rosmead military camp in the eastern Cape, observed a rotating set of red lights near their duty room, but these went out before they could investigate. When headmaster Harold Truter arrived about 10 minutes later at Rosmead Junior School, he observed an unusual light hovering silently over a nearby ridge, which was casting an oblique beam to the ground. A \'flickering glow\' over the school\'s locked tennis court caused him to investigate. Broken and molten asphalt and different sets of symmetrically placed imprints were found, subsequently considered to be a UFO landing site. Additional asphalt fragments were found strewn 183 m away on a nearby ridge, and nearby Eucalypt trees were badly scorched and soon died. Additional UFO sightings were claimed from the vicinity.\nOn 31 July 1975 Danie Van Graan, the owner of a farm near Loxton, at 7.50 saw a oval shaped object with rounded windows on the ground. Inside the object he could see four humanoid beings. As he approached, a beam of light was shone on his face and his nose bled. After some minutes the UFO took off.\nOn 29 September 1978 a resident Indian woman reported a disc-shaped object taking off from the Groendal Nature Reserve near Uitenhage, eastern Cape. Three days later, on 2 October, four school boys from Despatch, aged 12 to 16, observed three silvery-clad men in the reserve while hiking. Two of the men arrived from the direction of a shining object, and joined a third to ascend a steep incline on what seemed to be fins, before all disappeared. A set of 9 regular imprints found a month later, was deemed related to the reflective object.\n\n\n== 1991 to 2000 ==\nOn 7 April 1991, at 23:15 pm a hovering triangular craft with red central light, and white star-like lights on each extremity, was observed by a family at Baviaanspoort, Pretoria. A similar craft was sighted in the nearby Eersterust township on the evenings of 8 and 9 April, either stationary or moving. Around the same time in Belgium, the same or a similar craft was sighted.\nOn 18 November 1993, at 10:15 pm, Messrs du Plessis and Venter, residents of Sasolburg, observed a craft arriving from the direction of Vereeniging. The craft departed in a flash in the direction of Parys, but returned some three minutes later. The craft, similar in appearance to a water droplet, was observed to change colour and shape. With time individual lights were distinguished, and the body was determined to be cigar-shaped. While contained in a yellowish to orange glow, it emitted a downward blue light, before once again departing in a flash, upwards.  A nearby town resident claimed to have found imprints of a small craft\'s landing gear, some two months later.\nIn September and October 1994 a farmer at Warrenton claimed to have made repeated observations of a noisy, nighttime craft travelling at great speeds, besides what he described as a \'mothership\'. The craft\'s noise was compared to the sound of a helicopter or Volkswagen Beetle engine. The farmer\'s general claims were supported by four independent observers.\nA UFO flap swept South Africa from late March to mid April 1995, which was widely reported in the media. A farmer, Jan Pienaar, reported a landed craft south of Coligny.\nAt 4:00 am on 28 August 1996 a glowing disc was sighted by sergeant Becker near the Adriaan Vlok police station, Erasmuskloof, Pretoria. The pulsating light contained a red triangle and emitted bright green tentacles, while a radar operator at Johannesburg International confirmed its presence. A chase ensued involving some 200 policemen and a police helicopter. The helicopter chase was given up at 10,000 ft near Bronkhorstspruit, when the object made a vertical ascent. An object was sighted again during the early hours of 31 August and 1 September. See also: Petrozavodsk phenomenon.\nAround the end of July 1997 a hovering, cylindrical light or shiny cloud, was filmed by Andreas Mathios in the sky above the town of Trichardt, in the current western Mpumalanga province. Besides Mathios, it was independently observed by three other persons around 6:50am. The light suddenly dropped and rose again before disappearing. Sasol 2 and 3 allegedly had a temporary power outage that morning. Andreas Mathios phoned air traffic control to get information of any objects over the airspaceTrichardt was also the scene of a 1985 sighting.\nOn 27 December 1998 the Laubscher family videotaped a group of roundish triangular craft passing over the town of Graaff Reinet, at about 25,000 ft. These were changing colour and sometimes circled one another, before being overtaken by a much larger, shiny, gold-coloured craft. At this point all the objects departed to a cloud bank on the horizon.\nIn September 1997 Frank Valentyn (and apparently other motorists) observed an enormous stationary tower of about a dozen stacked discs from the N1 freeway in Pretoria. He suspected that those below were \"daughter discs\" released by the \"mothership\" above, which he estimated to be 1.7 kilometres (1.1 mi) in diameter. The lowest disc in the stack would detach and depart in a seemingly random direction at regular intervals, and each disc had a set of orange lights around its perimeter. He reported his observation to the Johannesburg Planetarium.\nOn 8 May 2000, at 3:24am, police inspector Kriel claimed to have observed an approaching UFO while travelling on the N3 freeway, 70 km north of Warden in the eastern Free State province. The orange, oval-shaped light was fitted with two cupolas, one above and another below, and was wide enough to cover four lanes of the freeway. After a close approach the craft receded again. A follow up report claimed that the vicinity is known for moving light apparitions.\n\n\n== 21st century ==\nOn 27 June 2004, Roshnie Naidu observed and video-taped a very bright, colourful light that was suspended near her home in Durban for 3 hours. She was able to alert family members and neighbours to its presence, and observed it changing shape from circular to oval.\nIn 2009 two formations of high-flying, orange-red objects, were seen by many witnesses, and video-recorded by some, as they travelled between the towns of Middelburg and Witbank, 25 kilometres (16 mi) apart. The first formation of 7 objects were seen at 21:51 on 27 February, as they flew westwards from Middelburg towards Witbank. Due to their altitude they eventually disappeared behind clouds. At 20:00 on 6 March, they were noted again high in the sky, but this time greater in number, 23, and traveling in the opposite direction.\nOn the evenings of 21 and 22 July 2010, residents of Booysens, Pretoria, observed a triangle of bright lights which hung motionless in the sky for two hours. In each instance the object commenced a slow descent towards the horizon at 20:30. Binocular observation revealed nothing more than a blue and emerald light, with a white light which shone straight downwards.\nOn the evenings of 11, 20 and 21 May 2011, a host of silent, orange lights with consistent luminosity were observed as they travelled faster than a commercial aeroplane over Tierpoort near Pretoria (some 20 objects) and Krugersdorp respectively. On 15 June seven of these objects were observed and some photographed as they crossed the sky in single file over Tierpoort. At 22:00 on 30 October 2011, a Mr van Greuning photographed two of the five silent fireballs which he observed traveling southwards in low cloud near the town of Harrismith.\nA reported UFO was spotted in Cape Town on the evening of 28 November 2015. Social media was abuzz with various reports of what seemed to be a green light over the city.\n\n\n== Abduction scenarios ==\n\n\n=== 1956 contactee ===\n\nA well-known photo series depicting a supposed UFO was taken on 24 July near Rosetta in the Drakensberg region. The photographer, meteorologist Elizabeth Klarer, claimed detailed adventures with an alien race, besides having had an alien lover, Akon, who would have fathered her son Ayling.\n\n\n=== 1974 abduction event ===\nTravellers Peter and Frances MacNorman claimed an abduction event on 31 May, which would have started near Fort Victoria in the current southern Zimbabwe, and which would have continued to the vicinity of Beitbridge on the South African border.\n\n\n=== 1979 Mindalore incident ===\nOn January 3, 1979, a mother and her 12-year-old son of Mindalore, Krugersdorp, both claimed an encounter with a group of human-like entities standing beside a craft. One of them would have encouraged her to depart with them permanently. After she refused, they would have entered the craft which shortly shot upwards and disappeared in 30 seconds.\n\n\n== Crash claims and hoaxes ==\n\n\n=== 1982 Mozambican border crash ===\nA person identifying himself only as an apartheid era brigadier general of the South African Army claimed in a 2004 Coast to Coast AM interview with Art Bell, that he was an eye-witness to a crashed disc in November 1982. From a Pretoria air force base, he would have given the order to a Mirage pilot flying hundreds of miles to the east, to fire on a suspected MiG aircraft, that was deemed a risk to ground troops. It allegedly turned out to be a disc, which was brought down very near the Mozambican border. He and his special operations team would have retrieved the 12 feet (3.7 m) wide craft holding two comatose grey beings, and returned these to Pretoria. The supposed artifacts were briefly held at Ysterplaat, Cape Town, before allegedly flown to Andrews Field near Washington, D.C., where U.S. officials took custody. Similar, but evidently baseless reports, have been tied to earlier and later dates.\n\n\n=== 1989 Kalahari crash ===\nAccording to supposed leaked documents an alien craft was shot down by South African aircraft, some 80 miles (130 kilometres) into Botswana, on 7 May. Two alien beings were claimed to have been captured on site. To date no primary witnesses have been traced, while the supporting documents, some obvious fakes, were all obtained from James van Greunen. Researcher Tony Dodd lent Van Greunen some credibility in Quest magazine, but other researchers were highly skeptical. The claims have nonetheless been widely circulated, either as fact or as a case deserving investigation.\n\n\n=== 1995 Lesotho crash ===\nAccording to supposed leaked documents an alien craft crashed in Lesotho on 15 September. It was claimed that South African forces retrieved the craft and took three alien beings captive. The source of these documents is unknown, but is once again suspected to be James van Greunen. Failing to trace any key individuals or witnesses, researcher Michael Hesemann denounced it as \'a complete hoax\'. Other researchers, though skeptical, held out hope to trace witnesses.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of reported UFO sightings\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nScans of Cynthia Hind\'s UFO Afrinews\nUfoRSA, UFO research of South Africa', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0c/Red_pog.svg'),

(124, 'Little green men', 'Little green men is the stereotypical portrayal of extraterrestrials as little humanoid-like creatures with green skin and sometimes with antennae on their heads. The term is also sometimes used to describe gremlins, mythical creatures known for causing problems in airplanes and mechanical devices. Today, these creatures are more commonly associated with an alleged alien species called greys, whose skin color is described as not green, but grey.\nDuring the reports of flying saucers in the 1950s, the term \"little green men\" came into popular usage in reference to aliens. In one classic case, the Kelly-Hopkinsville sighting in 1955, two rural Kentucky men described a supposed encounter with metallic-silver, somewhat humanoid-looking aliens no more than 4 feet (1 m) in height. Employing journalistic licence and deviating from the witnesses\' accounts, many newspaper articles used the term \"little green men\" in writing up the story.\n\n\n== Extraterrestrial definition ==\n\nUsage of the term clearly predates the 1955 incident; for example, in England reference to little green men or children dates back to the 12th century green children of Woolpit, though exactly when the term was first applied to extraterrestrial aliens has been difficult to pin down. Folklore researcher Chris Aubeck has used electronic searches of old newspapers and found a number of instances dating from around the turn of the 20th century referring to green aliens. Aubeck found one story from 1899 in the Atlanta Constitution, about a little green-skinned alien, in a tale called Green Boy From Hurrah, \"Hurrah\" being another planet, perhaps Mars. Edgar Rice Burroughs referred to the \"green men of Mars\" and \"green Martian women\" in his first 1912 science fiction novel A Princess of Mars, though at 10 to 12 feet tall, they were hardly \"little\". However, the first use of the specific phrase \"little green man\" in reference to extraterrestrials that Aubeck found dates to 1908 in the Daily Kennebec Journal (Augusta, Maine), in this case the aliens again being Martians. In 1910 (or 1915), a \"little green man\" was allegedly captured from his crashed spaceship in Apulia, in south-east Italy.Green aliens soon came to commonly portray extraterrestrials and adorned the covers of many of the 1920s to 1950s science fiction pulp magazines with pictures of Buck Rogers and Flash Gordon battling green alien monsters. The first documented print example specifically linking \"little green men\" to extraterrestrial spaceships is in a newspaper column satirizing the public panic following Orson Welles\' famous War of the Worlds Halloween broadcast of October 31, 1938. The column by reporter Bill Barnard in the Corpus Christi Times the next day begins, \"Thirteen little green men from Mercury stepped out of their space ship at Cliff Maus Field [local airport] late yesterday afternoon for a good-will visit to Corpus Christi\" and ends with, \"Then the 13 little green men got in their space ship and flew away.\" The familiarity with which the term was used suggests that this probably was not the first instance where it was applied to extraterrestrials in spaceships.\nIn 1946, Harold M. Sherman published a pulp science fiction book entitled The Green Man: A Visitor From Space. The cover illustration was of a normal-looking and proportioned human being, albeit with a green skin. Nationally syndicated columns by humorist Hal Boyle spoke of a green man from Mars in his flying saucer in early July 1947 during the height of the brand new flying saucer phenomenon in the U.S. that started June 24 after Kenneth Arnold\'s famous sighting and the Roswell UFO incident. However, Boyle did not describe his green Martian as \"small\".\nIn 1951, a science fiction book titled \"The Case of the Little Green Men\" was published by Mack Reynolds, telling of a private detective hired to investigate disguised aliens living among the human population. As he was being hired, the detective referred derisively and familiarly to the aliens in the flying saucers being \"little green men\". The cover illustration is notable for depicting the LGM with the classic antennae sticking out of the head. Mack Reynolds would go on to write the first Star Trek novel in 1968 (Mission to Horatius).By early 1950, stories began circulating in newspapers about little beings being recovered from flying saucer crashes. Though largely considered to be hoaxes, some of the stories from the sources about little aliens eventually made it into the popular 1950 book Behind the Flying Saucers by Variety magazine columnist Frank Scully.A witness reporting a flying saucer sighting to a Wichita, Kansas newspaper in June 1950 stated that he saw \"absolutely no little green men with egg on their whiskers\".Similarly, electronic searches show that \"little green men\" was specifically used in reference to science fiction and flying saucers by at least 1951 in the New York Times and Washington Post (in the Post, a book review of a mystery/science fiction novel called The Little Green Man), and 1952 in the Los Angeles Times and the Chicago Tribune (the Tribune mocking flying saucer reports using a \"little green man with pink polka dots\"). The next example of the New York Times using the term dates from 1955 in a book review of a sci-fi satire called Martians, Go Home. The Martians were obnoxious \"little green men\" whose appearance was \"true to prophecy\".\nIn a later example, following a nationally publicized flurry of UFO sightings in November 1957, syndicated Washington columnist Frederick Othman wrote: \"New Flying Saucer Epidemic On. All over this land again are flying saucers ... No little green men have climbed out of these celestial vehicles so far, but in another couple of days I wouldn\'t be surprised ...\"\n\n\n== Origins and other uses ==\nThe term also shows up much earlier in other contexts. Movie gossip columnist Hedda Hopper used it in 1939 referring to small cast members of the Wizard of Oz, and admonished against drinking on the set. In 1942, the Los Angeles Times used the term in a pictorial on Marines training for jungle combat. In this case, \"little green men\" referred to camouflaged Japanese soldiers. The Washington Post in 1942 likewise used the term \"little green man\" in reference to a camouflaged Japanese sniper who nearly killed one of their war correspondents.\nBefore its more modern application to aliens, little green men was commonly used to describe various supernatural beings in old legends and folklore and in later fairy tales and children\'s books such as goblins. Aubeck noted several examples of the latter in 19th and early 20th century literature. As an example, Rudyard Kipling had a \"little green man\" in Puck of Pook\'s Hill from 1906.\nAnother example, and the earliest use of little green man in the New York Times and Chicago Tribune, dates from 1902, in a review of a children\'s book called The Gift of the Magic Staff, where a supernatural \"Little Green Man\" is a boy\'s friend and helps him visit the cloudland fairies. The next use in the New York Times was in 1950, and references a planned movie by Walt Disney Corporation of a 1927 novel by poet/novelist Robert Nathan called The Woodcutter\'s House. The only animated character in the picture was to be Nathan\'s \"Little Green Man\", a confidant of the woodland animals. (The movie was never made.)\nIn 1923, a serialized romance, When Hearts Command by Elizabeth York Miller, which appeared in newspapers such as the Chicago Tribune and Washington Post, has a former mental patient who still sees \"little green men\" and who simultaneously comments that a fellow patient \"conversed with the inhabitants of Mars\".\nOther instances of imaginary small green beings have been found in a newspaper column from 1936 sarcastically discussing doctors and their medical advice, saying these are the same people who have breakdowns in middle age and start hallucinating \"a little green man with big ears\". Syndicated columnist Sydney J. Harris used \"little green man\" in 1948 as a child\'s imaginary friend while condemning the age-old tradition of frightening children with stories of \"boogeymen\".\nThese examples illustrate that use of little green men was already deeply engrained in English vernacular long before the flying saucer era, used for a variety of supernatural, imaginary, or mythical beings. It also seems to have easily extended beyond the imaginary to real people, such as the reference to small actors in the Wizard of Oz or camouflaged Japanese soldiers. Similarly, Aubeck and others suspect that when flying saucers came along in 1947, with subsequent speculation about alien origins, the term naturally and quickly attached itself to the modern age equivalent. It is also clear that by the early 1950s, the term was already commonly used as a sarcastic reference to the occupants of flying saucers. By 1954, the image of little green men had become inscribed in the public\'s collective consciousness.\nFurther electronic searches suggest that the term became increasingly more common in the 1960s and always used in a derisive or humorous way. The Chicago Tribune in 1960 carried a front-page story on the speculations of a Harvard anthropologist about how aliens might look and alien sex. The article opens with the comment, \"If there really are \'little green men\' out there in space, there are probably also little green women–and sex.\" A cartoon was attached showing two amorous centaur-like male and female aliens with antennae sticking out of their heads. The article also enigmatically states, \"The \'little green men\' designation came from Dr. Otto Struve, director of the national radio astronomy observatory, Green Bank, W. Va. He said that\'s what the possible outerspacers are called \'among themselves\'.\"\nThe term even penetrated into the commentary of the Wall Street Journal. First use in the Journal was 1960 in an article on the Brookings Report commissioned by NASA, studying the possible social effects of the discovery of extraterrestrial life. The Journal commented that they thought the report overly pessimistic, assuming that \"the little green men with the wiggly antennae\" would be hostile. Another Journal use of the term occurred in 1968 in an editorial on a planned Congressional investigation of UFOs. The writer sarcastically asked how they planned to subpoena \"a little green man\". In 1969, they commented that the Condon Committee UFO study commissioned by the Air Force was a waste of money. The editorial stated that even if they did prove that \"UFOs were people with little green men\", what were we supposed to do about it?By 1965, a little green man had even appeared in The Flintstones as a recurring character. The Great Gazoo (introduced in Episode 145) typified the representation of a little green man with his short, green stature and helmet with antennae. However, the 1960s also marked a transition in the way people imagined a stereotypical alien. In alien abduction stories they are often small but grey beings and in Arthur C. Clarke\'s 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) they are unseen.\n\n\n== Current usage ==\n\n\n=== Aliens ===\nLittle green aliens and the term \"little green men\" have fallen out of general use in serious science fiction circles and are typically only used by the uninformed or to ridicule the notion that aliens may exist, with a few exceptions, such as Yoda in the Star Wars movie saga. A derisive usage can be seen in the original Star Trek episode \"Tomorrow Is Yesterday\", set in 1969, as Captain Kirk, captured by the US Air Force while attempting to steal film showing the Enterprise in Earth\'s atmosphere, calls himself a \"little green man from Alpha Centauri\" when interrogated by the base security officer. Earlier in the same episode, a rescued Air Force captain brought aboard the Enterprise tells Kirk he\'s never believed in little green men, immediately before meeting the greenish-tinged Mr. Spock (who replies, \"Neither have I\"). In the 1988 Doctor Who Serial Remembrance of the Daleks, the line is parodied when the Doctor states that the Daleks are aliens. Group Captain Gilmore asks if he\'s fighting little green men, to which the Doctor says \"no, little green blobs in bonded polycarbide armour\".\nInstead, the little green alien image seems to have migrated mainly to the world of children\'s media where it can still be found in abundance (e.g. the small, green \"squeeze toy aliens\" in the 1995 film Toy Story and its sequels).\nThe Pokémon species \"Elgyem\" is based on little green men (\"LGM\") in its design, characteristics, and name.\nThe Irkens from Invader Zim bear a similarity to green little men.\nIn the space-simulation game Kerbal Space Program, Kerbals are the only species in the game and are portrayed as little green men with a large head compared to their bodies.\n\n\n=== \"Unidentified defending objects\" ===\nThe uniformed \"local self-defence\" forces, equipped with camouflage and modern Russian weaponry but lacking identifying badges or insignia, operating during the 2014 Russian military intervention in Ukraine were also called \"martians\" or \"little green men\" by the locals and the media.\n\n\n== Astronomy ==\nIn 1967, Jocelyn Bell Burnell and Antony Hewish of the University of Cambridge, UK dubbed the first discovered pulsar LGM-1 for \"little green men\" because the regular oscillations of its signal suggested a possible intelligent origin. Its designation was later changed to CP 1919, and is now known as PSR B1919+21.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nKaryl, Anna The Kelly Incident, 2004, ISBN 0-9752645-2-4\nRoth, Christopher F.

(125, 'Extraterrestrial life', 'Extraterrestrial life, also called alien life (or, if it is a sentient or relatively complex individual, an \"extraterrestrial\" or \"alien\"), is life that occurs outside of Earth and that probably did not originate from Earth. These hypothetical life forms may range from simple prokaryotes to beings with civilizations far more advanced than humanity. The Drake equation speculates about the existence of intelligent life elsewhere in the universe. The science of extraterrestrial life in all its forms is known as exobiology.\nSince the mid-20th century, there has been an ongoing search for signs of extraterrestrial life. This encompasses a search for current and historic extraterrestrial life, and a narrower search for extraterrestrial intelligent life. Depending on the category of search, methods range from  the analysis of telescope and specimen data to radios used to detect and send  communication signals.\nThe concept of extraterrestrial life, and particularly extraterrestrial intelligence, has had a major cultural impact, chiefly in works of science fiction. Over the years, science fiction communicated scientific ideas, imagined a wide range of possibilities, and influenced public interest in and perspectives of extraterrestrial life. One shared space is the debate over the wisdom of attempting communication with extraterrestrial intelligence.  Some encourage aggressive methods to try for contact with intelligent extraterrestrial life. Others—citing the tendency of technologically advanced human societies to enslave or wipe out less advanced societies—argue that it may be dangerous to actively call attention to Earth.\n\n\n== General ==\nAlien life, such as microorganisms, has been hypothesized to exist in the Solar System and throughout the universe. This hypothesis relies on the vast size and consistent physical laws of the observable universe. According to this argument, made by scientists such as Carl Sagan and Stephen Hawking, as well as well-regarded thinkers such as Winston Churchill, it would be improbable for life not to exist somewhere other than Earth. This argument is embodied in the Copernican principle, which states that Earth does not occupy a unique position in the Universe, and the mediocrity principle, which states that there is nothing special about life on Earth. The chemistry of life may have begun shortly after the Big Bang, 13.8 billion years ago, during a habitable epoch when the universe was only 10–17 million years old. Life may have emerged independently at many places throughout the universe. Alternatively, life may have formed less frequently, then spread—by meteoroids, for example—between habitable planets in a process called panspermia. In any case, complex organic molecules may have formed in the protoplanetary disk of dust grains surrounding the Sun before the formation of Earth. According to these studies, this process may occur outside Earth on several planets and moons of the Solar System and on planets of other stars.Since the 1950s, scientists have proposed that \"habitable zones\" around stars are the most likely places to find life. Numerous discoveries in such zones since 2007 have generated numerical estimates of Earth-like planets —in terms of composition—of many billions. As of  2013, only a few planets have been discovered in these zones. Nonetheless, on 4 November 2013, astronomers reported, based on Kepler space mission data, that there could be as many as 40 billion Earth-sized planets orbiting in the habitable zones of Sun-like stars and red dwarfs in the Milky Way, 11 billion of which may be orbiting Sun-like stars. The nearest such planet may be 12 light-years away, according to the scientists. Astrobiologists have also considered a \"follow the energy\" view of potential habitats.\n\n\n=== Evolution ===\nA study published in 2017 suggests that due to how complexity evolved in species on Earth, the level of predictability for alien evolution elsewhere would make them look similar to life on our planet. One of the study authors, Sam Levin, notes \"Like humans, we predict that they are made-up of a hierarchy of entities, which all cooperate to produce an alien. At each level of the organism there will be mechanisms in place to eliminate conflict, maintain cooperation, and keep the organism functioning. We can even offer some examples of what these mechanisms will be.\" There is also research in assessing the capacity of life for developing intelligence. It has been suggested that this capacity arises with the number of potential niches a planet contains, and that the complexity of life itself is reflected in the information density of planetary environments, which in turn can be computed from its niches.Biologist David Zeigler has argued that, based on evolutionary convergence from many different ancestral groups on Earth, a worm form is a likely life form on other life-bearing planets.\n\n\n== Biochemical basis ==\n\nLife on Earth requires water as a solvent in which biochemical reactions take place. Sufficient quantities of carbon and other elements, along with water, might enable the formation of living organisms on terrestrial planets with a chemical make-up and temperature range similar to that of Earth. More generally, life based on ammonia (rather than water) has been suggested, though this solvent appears less suitable than water. It is also conceivable that there are forms of life whose solvent is a liquid hydrocarbon, such as methane, ethane or propane.About 29 chemical elements play an active positive role in living organisms on Earth. About 95% of living matter is built upon only six elements: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur. These six elements form the basic building blocks of virtually all life on Earth, whereas most of the remaining elements are found only in trace amounts. The unique characteristics of carbon make it unlikely that it could be replaced, even on another planet, to generate the biochemistry necessary for life. The carbon atom has the unique ability to make four strong chemical bonds with other atoms, including other carbon atoms. These covalent bonds have a direction in space, so that carbon atoms can form the skeletons of complex 3-dimensional structures with definite architectures such as nucleic acids and proteins. Carbon forms more compounds than all other elements combined. The great versatility of the carbon atom makes it the element most likely to provide the bases—even exotic ones—for the chemical composition of life on other planets.\n\n\n== Planetary habitability in the Solar System ==\n\nSome bodies in the Solar System have the potential for an environment in which extraterrestrial life can exist, particularly those with possible subsurface oceans. Should life be discovered elsewhere in the Solar System, astrobiologists suggest that it will more likely be in the form of extremophile microorganisms. According to NASA\'s 2015 Astrobiology Strategy, \"Life on other worlds is most likely to include microbes, and any complex living system elsewhere is likely to have arisen from and be founded upon microbial life. Important insights on the limits of microbial life can be gleaned from studies of microbes on modern Earth, as well as their ubiquity and ancestral characteristics.\"Mars may have niche subsurface environments where microbial life might exist. A subsurface marine environment on Jupiter\'s moon Europa might be the most likely habitat in the Solar System, outside Earth, for extremophile microorganisms.The panspermia hypothesis proposes that life elsewhere in the Solar System may have a common origin. If extraterrestrial life was found on another body in the Solar System, it could have originated from Earth just as life on Earth could have been seeded from elsewhere (exogenesis). The first known mention of the term \'panspermia\' was in the writings of the 5th century BC Greek philosopher Anaxagoras. In the 19th century it was again revived in modern form by several scientists, including Jöns Jacob Berzelius (1834), Kelvin (1871), Hermann von Helmholtz (1879) and, somewhat later, by Svante Arrhenius (1903).Sir Fred Hoyle (1915–2001) and Chandra Wickramasinghe (born 1939) are important proponents of the hypothesis who further contended that life forms continue to enter Earth\'s atmosphere, and may be responsible for epidemic outbreaks, new diseases, and the genetic novelty necessary for macroevolution.Directed panspermia concerns the deliberate transport of microorganisms in space, sent to Earth to start life here, or sent from Earth to seed new stellar systems with life.\nThe Nobel prize winner Francis Crick, along with Leslie Orgel proposed that seeds of life may have been purposely spread by an advanced extraterrestrial civilization, but considering an early \"RNA world\" Crick noted later that life may have originated on Earth.\n\n\n=== Venus ===\n\nIn the early 20th century, Venus was often thought to be similar to Earth in terms of habitability, but observations since the beginning of the Space Age have revealed that Venus\'s surface is inhospitable to Earth-like life. However, between an altitude of 50 and 65 kilometers, the pressure and temperature are Earth-like, and it has been speculated that thermoacidophilic  extremophile microorganisms might exist in the acidic upper layers of the Venusian atmosphere. Furthermore, Venus likely had liquid water on its surface for at least a few million years after its formation.\n\n\n=== Mars ===\n\nLife on Mars has been long speculated. Liquid water is widely thought to have existed on Mars in the past, and now can occasionally be found as low-volume liquid brines in shallow Martian soil. The origin of the potential biosignature of methane observed in Mars\' atmosphere is unexplained, although hypotheses not involving life have also been proposed.There is evidence that Mars had a warmer and wetter past: dried-up river beds, polar ice caps, volcanoes, and minerals that form in the presence of water have all been found. Nevertheless, present conditions on Mars\' subsurface may support life. Evidence obtained by the Curiosity rover studying Aeolis Palus, Gale Crater in 2013 strongly suggests an ancient freshwater lake that could have been a hospitable environment for microbial life.Current studies on Mars by the Curiosity and Opportunity rovers are searching for evidence of ancient life, including a biosphere based on autotrophic, chemotrophic and/or chemolithoautotrophic microorganisms, as well as ancient water, including fluvio-lacustrine environments (plains related to ancient rivers or lakes) that may have been habitable. The search for evidence of habitability, taphonomy (related to fossils), and organic carbon on Mars is now a primary NASA objective.\n\n\n=== Ceres ===\nCeres, the only dwarf planet in the asteroid belt, has a thin water-vapor atmosphere. Frost on the surface may also have been detected in the form of bright spots. The presence of water on Ceres has led to speculation that life may be possible there.\n\n\n=== Jupiter system ===\n\n\n==== Jupiter ====\nCarl Sagan and others in the 1960s and 1970s computed conditions for hypothetical microorganisms living in the atmosphere of Jupiter. The intense radiation and other conditions, however, do not appear to permit encapsulation and molecular biochemistry, so life there is thought unlikely.  In contrast, some of Jupiter\'s moons may have habitats capable of sustaining life. Scientists have indications that heated subsurface oceans of liquid water may exist deep under the crusts of the three outer Galilean moons—Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. The EJSM/Laplace mission is planned to determine the habitability of these environments.\n\n\n==== Europa ====\n\nJupiter\'s moon Europa has been subject to speculation about the existence of life due to the strong possibility of a liquid water ocean beneath its ice surface. Hydrothermal vents on the bottom of the ocean, if they exist, may warm the ice and could be capable of supporting multicellular microorganisms. It is also possible that Europa could support aerobic macrofauna using oxygen created by cosmic rays impacting its surface ice.The case for life on Europa was greatly enhanced in 2011 when it was discovered that vast lakes exist within Europa\'s thick, icy shell. Scientists found that ice shelves surrounding the lakes appear to be collapsing into them, thereby providing a mechanism through which life-forming chemicals created in sunlit areas on Europa\'s surface could be transferred to its interior.On 11 December 2013, NASA reported the detection of \"clay-like minerals\" (specifically, phyllosilicates), often associated with organic materials, on the icy crust of Europa. The presence of the minerals may have been the result of a collision with an asteroid or comet according to the scientists. The Europa Clipper, which would assess the habitability of Europa, is planned for launch in 2025. Europa\'s subsurface ocean is considered the best target for the discovery of life.\n\n\n=== Saturn system ===\nTitan and Enceladus have been speculated to have possible habitats supportive of life.\n\n\n==== Enceladus ====\nEnceladus, a moon of Saturn, has some of the conditions for life, including geothermal activity and water vapor, as well as possible under-ice oceans heated by tidal effects. The Cassini–Huygens probe detected carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen and oxygen—all key elements for supporting life—during its 2005 flyby through one of Enceladus\'s geysers spewing ice and gas. The temperature and density of the plumes indicate a warmer, watery source beneath the surface.\n\n\n==== Titan ====\n\nTitan, the largest moon of Saturn, is the only known moon in the Solar System with a significant atmosphere. Data from the Cassini–Huygens mission refuted the hypothesis of a global hydrocarbon ocean, but later demonstrated the existence of liquid hydrocarbon lakes in the polar regions—the first stable bodies of surface liquid discovered outside Earth. Analysis of data from the mission has uncovered aspects of atmospheric chemistry near the surface that are consistent with—but do not prove—the hypothesis that organisms there if present, could be consuming hydrogen, acetylene and ethane, and producing methane.\n\n\n=== Small Solar System bodies ===\nSmall Solar System bodies have also been speculated to host habitats for extremophiles. Fred Hoyle and Chandra Wickramasinghe have proposed that microbial life might exist on comets and asteroids.\n\n\n=== Other bodies ===\nModels of heat retention and heating via radioactive decay in smaller icy Solar System bodies suggest that Rhea, Titania, Oberon, Triton, Pluto, Eris, Sedna, and Orcus may have oceans underneath solid icy crusts approximately 100 km thick. Of particular interest in these cases is the fact that the models indicate that the liquid layers are in direct contact with the rocky core, which allows efficient mixing of minerals and salts into the water. This is in contrast with the oceans that may be inside larger icy satellites like Ganymede, Callisto, or Titan, where layers of high-pressure phases of ice are thought to underlie the liquid water layer.Hydrogen sulfide has been proposed as a hypothetical solvent for life and is quite plentiful on Jupiter\'s moon Io, and may be in liquid form a short distance below the surface.\n\n\n== Scientific search ==\nThe scientific search for extraterrestrial life is being carried out both directly and indirectly. As of  September 2017, 3,667 exoplanets in 2,747 systems have been identified, and other planets and moons in our own solar system hold the potential for hosting primitive life such as microorganisms.\n\n\n=== Direct search ===\n\nScientists search for biosignatures within the Solar System by studying planetary surfaces and examining meteorites. Some claim to have identified evidence that microbial life has existed on Mars. An experiment on the two Viking Mars landers reported gas emissions from heated Martian soil samples that some scientists argue are consistent with the presence of living microorganisms. Lack of corroborating evidence from other experiments on the same samples suggests that a non-biological reaction is a more likely hypothesis. In 1996, a controversial report stated that structures resembling nanobacteria were discovered in a meteorite, ALH84001, formed of rock ejected from Mars.\n\nIn February 2005, NASA scientists reported that they may have found some evidence of present life on Mars. The two scientists, Carol Stoker and Larry Lemke of NASA\'s Ames Research Center, based their claim on methane signatures found in Mars\'s atmosphere resembling the methane production of some forms of primitive life on Earth, as well as on their own study of primitive life near the Rio Tinto river in Spain. NASA officials soon distanced NASA from the scientists\' claims, and Stoker herself backed off from her initial assertions. Though such methane findings are still debated, support among some scientists for the existence of life on Mars exists.In November 2011, NASA launched the Mars Science Laboratory that landed the Curiosity rover on Mars. It is designed to assess the past and present habitability on Mars using a variety of scientific instruments. The rover landed on Mars at Gale Crater in August 2012.The Gaia hypothesis stipulates that any planet with a robust population of life will have an atmosphere in chemical disequilibrium, which is relatively easy to determine from a distance by spectroscopy. However, significant advances in the ability to find and resolve light from smaller rocky worlds near their star are necessary before such spectroscopic methods can be used to analyze extrasolar planets. To that effect, the Carl Sagan Institute was founded in 2014 and is dedicated to the atmospheric characterization of exoplanets in circumstellar habitable zones. Planetary spectroscopic data will be obtained  from telescopes like WFIRST and ELT.In August 2011, findings by NASA, based on studies of meteorites found on Earth, suggest DNA and RNA components (adenine, guanine and related organic molecules), building blocks for life as we know it, may be formed extraterrestrially in outer space. In October 2011, scientists reported that cosmic dust contains complex organic matter (\"amorphous organic solids with a mixed aromatic-aliphatic structure\") that could be created naturally, and rapidly, by stars. One of the scientists suggested that these compounds may have been related to the development of life on Earth and said that, \"If this is the case, life on Earth may have had an easier time getting started as these organics can serve as basic ingredients for life.\"In August 2012, and in a world first, astronomers at Copenhagen University reported the detection of a specific sugar molecule, glycolaldehyde, in a distant star system. The molecule was found around the protostellar binary IRAS 16293-2422, which is located 400 light years from Earth.  Glycolaldehyde is needed to form ribonucleic acid, or RNA, which is similar in function to DNA.  This finding suggests that complex organic molecules may form in stellar systems prior to the formation of planets, eventually arriving on young planets early in their formation.\n\n\n=== Indirect search ===\nProjects such as SETI are monitoring the galaxy for electromagnetic interstellar communications from civilizations on other worlds. If there is an advanced extraterrestrial civilization, there is no guarantee that it is transmitting radio communications in the direction of Earth or that this information could be interpreted as such by humans.  The length of time required for a signal to travel across the vastness of space means that any signal detected would come from the distant past.The presence of heavy elements in a star\'s light-spectrum is another potential biosignature; such elements would (in theory) be found if the star was being used as an incinerator/repository for nuclear waste products.\n\n\n=== Extrasolar planets ===\n\nSome astronomers search for extrasolar planets that may be conducive to life, narrowing the search to terrestrial planets within the habitable zone of their star. Since 1992 over two thousand exoplanets have been discovered (3,946 planets in 2,945 planetary systems including 650 multiple planetary systems as of 1 January 2019).\nThe extrasolar planets so far discovered range in size from that of terrestrial planets similar to Earth\'s size to that of gas giants larger than Jupiter.  The number of observed exoplanets is expected to increase greatly in the coming years.The Kepler space telescope has also detected a few thousand candidate planets, of which about 11% may be false positives.There is at least one planet on average per star. About 1 in 5 Sun-like stars have an \"Earth-sized\" planet in the habitable zone, with the nearest expected to be within 12 light-years distance from Earth. Assuming 200 billion stars in the Milky Way, that would be 11 billion potentially habitable Earth-sized planets in the Milky Way, rising to 40 billion if red dwarfs are included. The rogue planets in the Milky Way possibly number in the trillions.The nearest known exoplanet is Proxima Centauri b, located 4.2 light-years (1.3 pc) from Earth in the southern constellation of Centaurus.As of  March 2014, the least massive planet known is PSR B1257+12 A, which is about twice the mass of the Moon. The most massive planet listed on the NASA Exoplanet Archive is DENIS-P J082303.1-491201 b, about 29 times the mass of Jupiter, although according to most definitions of a planet, it is too massive to be a planet and may be a brown dwarf instead. Almost all of the planets detected so far are within the Milky Way, but there have also been a few possible detections of extragalactic planets.  The study of planetary habitability also considers a wide range of other factors in determining the suitability of a planet for hosting life.One sign that a planet probably already contains life is the presence of an atmosphere with significant amounts of oxygen, since that gas is highly reactive and generally would not last long without constant replenishment. This replenishment occurs on Earth through photosynthetic organisms. One way to analyze the atmosphere of an exoplanet is through spectrography when it transits its star, though this might only be feasible with dim stars like white dwarfs.\n\n\n=== Terrestrial analysis ===\nThe science of astrobiology considers life on Earth as well, and in the broader astronomical context. In 2015, \"remains of biotic life\" were found in 4.1 billion-year-old rocks in Western Australia, when the young Earth was about 400 million years old. According to one of the researchers, \"If life arose relatively quickly on Earth, then it could be common in the universe.\"\n\n\n== The Drake equation ==\n\nIn 1961, University of California, Santa Cruz, astronomer and astrophysicist  Frank Drake devised the Drake equation as a way to stimulate scientific dialogue at a meeting on the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI). The Drake equation is a probabilistic argument used to estimate the number of active, communicative extraterrestrial civilizations in the Milky Way  galaxy. The equation is best understood not as an equation in the strictly mathematical sense, but to summarize all the various concepts which scientists must contemplate when considering the question of life elsewhere.  The Drake equation is:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        N\n        =\n        \n          R\n          \n            ∗\n          \n        \n        ⋅\n        \n          f\n          \n            p\n          \n        \n        ⋅\n        \n          n\n          \n            e\n          \n        \n        ⋅\n        \n          f\n          \n            ℓ\n          \n        \n        ⋅\n        \n          f\n          \n            i\n          \n        \n        ⋅\n        \n          f\n          \n            c\n          \n        \n        ⋅\n        L\n      \n    \n    {displaystyle N=R_{ast }cdot f_{p}cdot n_{e}cdot f_{ell }cdot f_{i}cdot f_{c}cdot L}\n  where:\n\nN = the number of Milky Way galaxy civilizations already capable of communicating across interplanetary spaceand\n\nR* = the average rate of star formation in our galaxy\nfp = the fraction of those stars that have planets\nne = the average number of planets that can potentially support life\nfl = the fraction of planets that actually support life\nfi = the fraction of planets with life that evolves to become intelligent life (civilizations)\nfc = the fraction of civilizations that develop a technology to broadcast detectable signs of their existence into space\nL = the length of time over which such civilizations broadcast detectable signals into spaceDrake\'s proposed estimates are as follows, but numbers on the right side of the equation are agreed as speculative and open to substitution:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        10,000\n        =\n        5\n        ⋅\n        0.5\n        ⋅\n        2\n        ⋅\n        1\n        ⋅\n        0.2\n        ⋅\n        1\n        ⋅\n        10,000\n      \n    \n    {displaystyle 10{,}000=5cdot 0.5cdot 2cdot 1cdot 0.2cdot 1cdot 10{,}000}\n  The Drake equation has proved controversial since several of its factors are uncertain and based on conjecture, not allowing conclusions to be made. This has led critics to label the equation a guesstimate, or even meaningless.\nBased on observations from the Hubble Space Telescope, there are between 125 and 250 billion galaxies in the observable universe. It is estimated that at least ten percent of all Sun-like stars have a system of planets, i.e. there are 6.25×1018 stars with planets orbiting them in the observable universe. Even if it is assumed that only one out of a billion of these stars has planets supporting life, there would be some 6.25 billion life-supporting planetary systems in the observable universe.\nA 2013 study based on results from the Kepler spacecraft estimated that the Milky Way contains at least as many planets as it does stars, resulting in 100–400 billion exoplanets. Also based on Kepler data, scientists estimate that at least one in six stars has an Earth-sized planet.The apparent contradiction between high estimates of the probability of the existence of extraterrestrial civilizations and the lack of evidence for such civilizations is known as the Fermi paradox.\n\n\n== Cultural impact ==\n\n\n=== Cosmic pluralism ===\n\nCosmic pluralism, the plurality of worlds, or simply pluralism, describes the philosophical belief in numerous \"worlds\" in addition to Earth, which might harbor extraterrestrial life. Before the development of the heliocentric theory and a recognition that the Sun is just one of many stars, the notion of pluralism was largely mythological and philosophical. Medieval Muslim writers like Fakhr al-Din al-Razi and Muhammad al-Baqir supported cosmic pluralism on the basis of the Qur\'an.With the scientific and Copernican revolutions, and later, during the Enlightenment, cosmic pluralism became a mainstream notion, supported by the likes of Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle in his 1686 work Entretiens sur la pluralité des mondes. Pluralism was also championed by philosophers such as John Locke, Giordano Bruno and astronomers such as William Herschel. The astronomer Camille Flammarion promoted the notion of cosmic pluralism in his 1862 book La pluralité des mondes habités. None of these notions of pluralism were based on any specific observation or scientific information.\n\n\n=== Early modern period ===\nThere was a dramatic shift in thinking initiated by the invention of the telescope and the Copernican assault on geocentric cosmology. Once it became clear that Earth was merely one planet amongst countless bodies in the universe, the theory of extraterrestrial life started to become a topic in the scientific community. The best known early-modern proponent of such ideas was the Italian philosopher Giordano Bruno, who argued in the 16th century for an infinite universe in which every star is surrounded by its own planetary system. Bruno wrote that other worlds \"have no less virtue nor a nature different to that of our earth\" and, like Earth, \"contain animals and inhabitants\".In the early 17th century, the Czech astronomer Anton Maria Schyrleus of Rheita mused that \"if Jupiter has (...) inhabitants (...) they must be larger and more beautiful than the inhabitants of Earth, in proportion to the [characteristics] of the two spheres\".In Baroque literature such as The Other World: The Societies and Governments of the Moon by Cyrano de Bergerac, extraterrestrial societies are presented as humoristic or ironic parodies of earthly society.\nThe didactic poet Henry More took up the classical theme of the Greek Democritus in \"Democritus Platonissans, or an Essay Upon the Infinity of Worlds\" (1647).\nIn \"The Creation: a Philosophical Poem in Seven Books\" (1712), Sir Richard Blackmore observed: \"We may pronounce each orb sustains a race / Of living things adapted to the place\". With the new relative viewpoint that the Copernican revolution had wrought, he suggested \"our world\'s sunne / Becomes a starre elsewhere\". Fontanelle\'s \"Conversations on the Plurality of Worlds\" (translated into English in 1686) offered similar excursions on the possibility of extraterrestrial life, expanding, rather than denying, the creative sphere of a Maker.\nThe possibility of extraterrestrials remained a widespread speculation as scientific discovery accelerated. William Herschel, the discoverer of Uranus, was one of many 18th–19th-century astronomers who believed that the Solar System is populated by alien life. Other luminaries of the period who championed \"cosmic pluralism\" included Immanuel Kant and Benjamin Franklin. At the height of the Enlightenment, even the Sun and Moon were considered candidates for extraterrestrial inhabitants.\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\n\nSpeculation about life on Mars increased in the late 19th century, following telescopic observation of apparent Martian canals—which soon, however, turned out to be optical illusions. Despite this, in 1895, American astronomer Percival Lowell published his book Mars, followed by Mars and its Canals in 1906, proposing that the canals were the work of a long-gone civilization. The idea of life on Mars led British writer H. G. Wells to write the novel The War of the Worlds in 1897, telling of an invasion by aliens from Mars who were fleeing the planet\'s desiccation.\nSpectroscopic analysis of Mars\'s atmosphere began in earnest in 1894, when U.S. astronomer William Wallace Campbell showed that neither water nor oxygen was present in the Martian atmosphere.\nBy 1909 better telescopes and the best perihelic opposition of Mars since 1877 conclusively put an end to the canal hypothesis.\nThe science fiction genre, although not so named during the time, developed during the late 19th century. Jules Verne\'s Around the Moon (1870) features a discussion of the possibility of life on the Moon, but with the conclusion that it is barren.\nStories involving extraterrestrials are found in e.g. Garrett P. Serviss\'s Edison\'s Conquest of Mars (1898), an unauthorized sequel to\nThe War of the Worlds by H. G. Wells was published in 1897 which stands at the beginning of the popular idea of the \"Martian invasion\" of Earth prominent in 20th-century pop culture.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\nMost unidentified flying objects or UFO sightings can be readily explained as sightings of Earth-based aircraft, known astronomical objects, or as hoaxes. Nonetheless, a certain fraction of the public believe that UFOs might actually be of extraterrestrial origin, and, indeed, the notion has had influence on popular culture.\nThe possibility of extraterrestrial life on the Moon was ruled out in the 1960s, and during the 1970s it became clear that most of the other bodies of the Solar System do not harbor highly developed life, although the question of primitive life on bodies in the Solar System remains open.\n\n\n=== Recent history ===\nThe failure so far of the SETI program to detect an intelligent radio signal after decades of effort has at least partially dimmed the prevailing optimism of the beginning of the space age. Notwithstanding, belief in extraterrestrial beings continues to be voiced in pseudoscience, conspiracy theories, and in popular folklore, notably \"Area 51\" and legends. It has become a pop culture trope given less-than-serious treatment in popular entertainment.\nIn the words of SETI\'s Frank Drake, \"All we know for sure is that the sky is not littered with powerful microwave transmitters\". Drake noted that it is entirely possible that advanced technology results in communication being carried out in some way other than conventional radio transmission. At the same time, the data returned by space probes, and giant strides in detection methods, have allowed science to begin delineating habitability criteria on other worlds, and to confirm that at least other planets are plentiful, though aliens remain a question mark. The Wow! signal, detected in 1977 by a SETI project, remains a subject of speculative debate.\nIn 2000, geologist and paleontologist Peter Ward and astrobiologist Donald Brownlee published a book entitled Rare Earth: Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe. In it, they discussed the Rare Earth hypothesis, in which they claim that Earth-like life is rare in the universe, whereas microbial life is common. Ward and Brownlee are open to the idea of evolution on other planets that is not based on essential Earth-like characteristics (such as DNA and carbon).\nTheoretical physicist Stephen Hawking in 2010 warned that humans should not try to contact alien life forms. He warned that aliens might pillage Earth for resources. \"If aliens visit us, the outcome would be much as when Columbus landed in America, which didn\'t turn out well for the Native Americans\", he said. Jared Diamond had earlier expressed similar concerns.In November 2011, the White House released an official response to two petitions asking the U.S. government to acknowledge formally that aliens have visited Earth and to disclose any intentional withholding of government interactions with extraterrestrial beings. According to the response, \"The U.S. government has no evidence that any life exists outside our planet, or that an extraterrestrial presence has contacted or engaged any member of the human race.\" Also, according to the response, there is \"no credible information to suggest that any evidence is being hidden from the public\'s eye.\" The response noted \"odds are pretty high\" that there may be life on other planets but \"the odds of us making contact with any of them—especially any intelligent ones—are extremely small, given the distances involved.\"In 2013, the exoplanet Kepler-62f was discovered, along with Kepler-62e and Kepler-62c. A related special issue of the journal Science, published earlier, described the discovery of the exoplanets.On 17 April 2014, the discovery of the Earth-size exoplanet Kepler-186f, 500 light-years from Earth, was publicly announced; it is the first Earth-size planet to be discovered in the habitable zone and it has been hypothesized that there may be liquid water on its surface.\nOn 13 February 2015, scientists (including Geoffrey Marcy, Seth Shostak, Frank Drake and David Brin) at a convention of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, discussed Active SETI and whether transmitting a message to possible intelligent extraterrestrials in the Cosmos was a good idea; one result was a statement, signed by many, that a \"worldwide scientific, political and humanitarian discussion must occur before any message is sent\".On 20 July 2015, British physicist Stephen Hawking and Russian billionaire Yuri Milner, along with the SETI Institute, announced a well-funded effort, called the Breakthrough Initiatives, to expand efforts to search for extraterrestrial life.  The group contracted the services of the 100-meter Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope in West Virginia in the United States and the 64-meter Parkes Telescope in New South Wales, Australia.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a8/ALH84001_structures.jpg'),
(126, 'Sperry UFO case', 'The Sperry UFO case was a sighting of an Unidentified Flying Object by the captain, Willis Sperry, and other crew of an American Airlines DC-6 airborne near Mount Vernon, Maryland on 29 May 1950.\nMedia exposure of the case helped to establish a popular perception of UFOs being reported by \"credible\" witnesses such as airline pilots; Sperry was interviewed for several newspapers and was later featured in Clarence Greene\'s 1956 semi-documentary film Unidentified Flying Objects: The true story of flying saucers.\n\n\n== The sighting ==\nSperry\'s aircraft had left Washington Airport at 9:10 pm EST on a flight to Nashville and was climbing to 20,000 ft. Weather conditions were clear, with the ground obscured by haze, and a full moon around 25° above the horizon. At approximately 9:30pm, seven miles west of Mount Vernon, copilot W. Gates alerted Sperry to a bright blue or bluish light ahead of them and increasing in size. In a letter to Flying magazine several months later, Sperry described the light as \"a brilliant, diffused, bluish light of fluorescent type [...] 25 times the magnitude of the brightest star\". To avert a possible collision, Sperry banked the aircraft and changed course 45° to the right; the light appeared to stop before changing course to parallel the aircraft on the left.\nDuring this period the light very briefly passed between the aircraft and the upper part of the moon, revealing an object with a long silhouette (somewhat reminiscent of a submarine) without visible wings or empennage. In his 1950 letter, Sperry stated the blue light was on the front of the object, which was also seen by the copilot and by flight engineer R. Arnholt.The object having appeared to pass behind the left wing, the pilots banked to the left and resumed their previous course, but Gates spotted the light again through the right window \"as though it had circled behind them\". The light then appeared to head eastwards behind the aircraft, and was observed again by Sperry towards the rear left travelling in the direction of the Atlantic; he estimated the total time of observation as around one minute, during which time the light had appeared to be completely stationary at least twice.Sperry reported his observations to Washington control tower, but they had observed nothing on radar. He also spoke to his passengers, stating that one man had seen an \"extremely bright light passing the left side of the ship\".\n\n\n== Later interviews ==\nApart from newspaper interviews immediately following the sighting, the press having been notified by control tower staff, and his appearance in the 1956 film (where the case was featured alongside the Mantell Incident, Gorman Dogfight and others considered unexplained at the time), Sperry was also interviewed by KABC-TV in 1964. He and Arnholt were further interviewed in 1968 by the prominent ufologist Dr James E. McDonald.Sperry later learned that Hank Myers, subsequently pilot of President Harry S. Truman\'s plane, had been piloting another Washington-bound AAA aircraft between Nashville and Knoxville on the same night, and had witnessed a bright meteor which fell eastward from the zenith, but which then appeared to move horizontally for several seconds. Comparing times and the relative position of his aircraft with that of Myers, Sperry felt that this was possibly the same phenomenon or object as he saw. Both he and Gates, the copilot, had however \"emphatically discounted\" the possibility of the phenomenon being a meteor, due to its movements.\n\n\n== See also ==\nEdward J. Ruppelt\nThe case bears some surface resemblance to the Chiles-Whitted UFO Encounter, an incident which had a strong influence on the development of popular perceptions of UFOs.\n\n\n== References ==', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/Unbalanced_scales.svg'),
(127, 'Aurora, Texas, UFO incident', 'The Aurora, Texas, UFO incident reportedly occurred on April 17, 1897 when, according to locals, a UFO crashed on a farm near Aurora, Texas.  The incident (similar to the more famous Roswell UFO incident 50 years later) is claimed to have resulted in a fatality from the crash and the alleged alien body is to have been buried in an unmarked grave at the local cemetery.\n\n\n== The incident as reported ==\n\nDuring the 1896–1897 timeframe, numerous sightings of a cigar-shaped mystery airship were reported across the United States.\nOne of these accounts appeared in the April 17, 1897, edition of the Dallas Morning News. Written by Aurora resident S.E. Haydon, the alleged UFO is said to have hit a windmill on the property of a Judge J.S. Proctor two days earlier at around 6am local (Central) time, resulting in its crash. The pilot (who was reported to be \"not of this world\", and a \"Martian\" according to a reported Army officer from nearby Fort Worth) did not survive the crash, and was buried \"with Christian rites\" at the nearby Aurora Cemetery. (The cemetery contains a Texas Historical Commission marker mentioning the incident.)\nReportedly, wreckage from the crash site was dumped into a nearby well located under the damaged windmill, while some ended up with the alien in the grave. Adding to the mystery was the story of Mr. Brawley Oates, who purchased Judge Proctor\'s property around 1935. Oates cleaned out the debris from the well in order to use it as a water source, but later developed an extremely severe case of arthritis, which he claimed to be the result of contaminated water from the wreckage dumped into the well. As a result, Oates sealed up the well with a concrete slab and placed an outbuilding atop the slab. (According to writing on the slab, this was done in 1957.)\n\n\n== Hoax theory ==\n \nThe hoax theory is primarily based on historical research performed by Barbara Brammer, a former mayor of Aurora. Her research (featured as part of the UFO Files episode on the incident) revealed that, in the months prior to the alleged crash, Aurora had been beset by a series of tragic incidents:\n\nFirst, the local cotton crop (the major source of town revenue) was destroyed by a boll weevil infestation.\nSecond, a fire on the town\'s west side claimed several buildings and lives.\nShortly after the fire, a spotted fever epidemic hit the town, nearly wiping out the remaining citizens and placing the town under quarantine.\nFinally, a planned railroad got within 27 miles of Aurora, but never made it into the town.Essentially, Aurora (which claimed nearly 3,000 residents at the time) was in serious danger of dying out; Brammer\'s research also showed that Haydon was known in the town to be a bit of a jokester, and her conclusion is that Haydon\'s article was a last-ditch attempt to keep Aurora alive.\nThe theory was further supported by the fact that Haydon never performed any sort of follow-up on the story, not even to report on the alien\'s burial, which is highly unusual given the significance of the event.\nFurther, in 1979, Time magazine interviewed Etta Pegues, an 86 year old Aurora resident who claimed that Haydon had fabricated the entire story, stating that Haydon \"wrote it as a joke and to bring interest to Aurora. The railroad bypassed us, and the town was dying.\" Pegues further claimed that Judge Proctor never operated a windmill on his property, a statement later refuted as part of the UFO Hunters episode, which found the base of a wooden water pump tower constructed around the well.\nJim Marrs interviewed an eye witness who allegedly saw the UFO crash; also, the Judge’s windmill technically was not a windmill but a three-story wooden water pump tower.\n\n\n== Investigations ==\n\nThe incident has been investigated on numerous occasions. One report was broadcast by local television station KDFW FOX 4 and two other reports aired on cable television.\n\n\n=== KDFW report ===\nIn 1998, Dallas-based TV station KDFW aired a lengthy report about the Aurora incident. Reporter Richard Ray interviewed former Fort Worth Star Telegram reporter Jim Marrs and other locals, who said something crashed in Aurora. However, Ray\'s report was unable to find conclusive evidence of extraterrestrial life or technology. Ray reported that the State of Texas erected a historical plaque in town that outlines the tale and labels it \"legend.\"\n\n\n=== UFO Files investigation ===\nOn December 19, 2005, UFO Files first aired an episode related to this incident, titled \"Texas\' Roswell\". The episode featured a 1973 investigation led by Bill Case, an aviation writer for the Dallas Times Herald and the Texas state director of Mutual UFO Network (MUFON).\nMUFON uncovered two new eyewitnesses to the crash. Mary Evans, who was 15 at the time, told of how her parents went to the crash site (they forbade her from going) and the discovery of the alien body. Charlie Stephens, who was age 10, told how he saw the airship trailing smoke as it headed north toward Aurora. He wanted to see what happened, but his father made him finish his chores; later, he told how his father went to town the next day and saw wreckage from the crash.\nMUFON then investigated the Aurora Cemetery, and uncovered a grave marker that appeared to show a flying saucer of some sort, as well as readings from its metal detector. MUFON asked for permission to exhume the site, but the cemetery association declined permission. After the MUFON investigation, the marker mysteriously disappeared from the cemetery and a three-inch pipe was placed into the ground; MUFON\'s metal detector no longer picked up metal readings from the grave, thus it was presumed that the metal was removed from the grave.\nMUFON\'s report eventually stated that the evidence was inconclusive, but did not rule out the possibility of a hoax. The episode featured an interview with Mayor Brammer who discussed the town\'s tragic history.\n\n\n=== UFO Hunters investigation ===\nOn November 19, 2008, UFO Hunters first aired another television documentary regarding the Aurora incident, titled \"First Contact\".\nThe documentary featured one notable change from the UFO Files story – Tim Oates, grandson of Brawley Oates and the now-owner of the property with the sealed well where the UFO wreckage was purportedly buried, allowed the investigators to unseal the well, in order to examine it for possible debris. Water was taken from the well which tested normal except for large amounts of aluminum present; the well had no significant contents. It was stated in the episode that any large pieces of metal had been removed from the well by a past owner of the property. Further, the remains of a windmill base were found near the well site, which refuted Ms. Pegues\' statements (from the 1979 Time magazine article) that Judge Proctor never had a windmill on his property.\nIn addition, the Aurora Cemetery was again examined. Although the cemetery association still did not permit exhumation, using ground-penetrating radar and photos from prior visits, an unmarked grave was found in the area near other 1890s graves. However, the condition of the grave was badly deteriorated, and the radar could not conclusively prove what type of remains existed.\n\n\n== In Popular Culture ==\nThe incident is dramatised in the 1986 film The Aurora Encounter, as well as being discussed within History Channel\'s Ancient Aliens third-season premiere (entitled Aliens and the Old West) that focuses on late 19th-century UFO sightings in western North America.\nAn independent short movie co-written and co-directed by musician and historian Thomas Negovan and Aaron Shaps simply entitled Aurora dramatises the incident as well as combines it with the Nazi conspiracy theory of Die Glocke .\nThe incident is satirized in The Firesign Theatre\'s 1974 comedy LP Everything You Know Is Wrong, performed from about 3:00 to 4:42 on Side A, with following thematic references .\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of UFO sightings\nMystery airship\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nKDFW report\nAurora Texas UFO Incident – UFO casebook study\nOriginal newspaper article by S.E.

(128, 'Indigo children', 'Indigo children, according to a pseudoscientific New Age concept, are children who are believed to possess special, unusual, and sometimes supernatural traits or abilities. The idea is based on concepts developed in the 1970s by Nancy Ann Tappe and further developed by Lee Carroll and Jan Tober. The concept of indigo children gained popular interest with the publication of a series of books in the late 1990s and the release of several films in the following decade. A variety of books, conferences and related materials have been created surrounding belief in the idea of indigo children and their nature and abilities. The interpretations of these beliefs range from their being the next stage in human evolution, in some cases possessing paranormal abilities such as telepathy, to the belief that they are more empathetic and creative than their peers.\nNo scientific studies give credibility to the existence of indigo children or their traits. Some parents choose to label their children who have been diagnosed with learning disabilities as an indigo child to alternatively diagnose them. Critics view this as a way for parents to avoid considering pediatric treatment or a psychiatric diagnosis. Some lists of traits used to describe indigo children have also been criticized for being vague enough to be applied to most people, a form of the Forer effect.\n\n\n== Origins ==\nThe term \"indigo children\" originated with parapsychologist and self-described synesthete and psychic Nancy Ann Tappe, who developed the concept in the 1970s. In 1982 Tappe published a comb-bound which she expanded and republished in paperback in 1986 as Understanding Your Life Thru Color. In these works Tappe introduced the concept of \"life colors\", defined in Understanding Your Life Thru Color as \"the single color of the aura that remains constant in most people from the cradle to the grave\". The concept of \"life colors\" was popularized nationally by Tappe\'s student Barbara Bowers, who published What Color Is Your Aura?: Personality Spectrums for Understanding and Growth in 1989, and by Bowers\' student Pamala Oslie, who published Life Colors:  What the Colors in Your Aura Reveal in 1991.Tappe stated that during the late 1960s and early 1970s she began noticing that many children were being born with indigo auras (or, in her terminology, with indigo as their \"life color\"). The idea was later popularized by the 1998 book The Indigo Children:  The New Kids Have Arrived, written by husband and wife self-help lecturers Lee Carroll and Jan Tober.In 2002, the first international conference on indigo children was held in Hawaii, drawing 600 attendees, and there have been subsequent conferences in Florida, Oregon, and elsewhere. Several films have been produced on the subject, including two films by New Age writer James Twyman: a 2003 feature film Indigo and a 2006 documentary The Indigo Evolution.Sarah W. Whedon suggests in a 2009 article in Nova Religio that the social construction of indigo children is a response to an \"apparent crisis of American childhood\" in the form of increased youth violence and diagnoses of attention deficit disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.  Whedon believes parents label their children as \"indigo\" to provide an alternative explanation for their children\'s improper behavior stemming from ADD and ADHD.\n\n\n== Claimed characteristics ==\nDescriptions of indigo children include that they:\nAre empathetic, curious, and strong-willed\nAre often perceived by friends and family as being strange\nPossess a clear sense of self-definition and purpose\nShow a strong innate subconscious spirituality from early childhood (which, however, does not necessarily imply a direct interest in spiritual or religious areas)\nHave a strong feeling of entitlement, or deserving to be hereOther alleged traits include:\nHigh intelligence quotient\nInherent intuitive ability\nResistance to rigid, control-based paradigms of authorityAccording to Tober and Carroll, indigo children may function poorly in conventional schools due to their rejection of rigid authority, their being smarter or more spiritually mature than their teachers, and their lack of response to guilt-, fear- or manipulation-based discipline.According to research psychologist Russell Barkley, the New Age movement has yet to produce empirical evidence of the existence of indigo children, as the traits most commonly attributed to them are closely aligned with the Forer effect—so vague that they could describe nearly anyone. Many critics see the concept of indigo children as made up of extremely general traits, a sham diagnosis that is an alternative to a medical diagnosis, with a complete lack of science or studies to support it.\n\n\n=== Indigo as an alternative to diagnosis ===\nRetired professor of philosophy and skeptic Robert Todd Carroll notes that many of the commentators on the indigo phenomenon are of varying qualifications and expertise, and parents may prefer labeling their child an indigo as an alternative to a diagnosis that implies poor parenting, narcissistic parenting, damage, or mental illness. This is a belief echoed by academic psychologists. Some mental health experts are concerned that labeling a disruptive child an \"indigo\" may delay proper diagnosis and treatment that could help the child or look into the parenting style that may be causing the behavior. Others have stated that many of the traits of indigo children could be more prosaically interpreted as simple unruliness and alertness.\n\n\n=== Relationship to attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder ===\nMany children labeled indigo by their parents are diagnosed with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and Tober and Carroll\'s book The Indigo Children linked the concept with diagnosis of ADHD.  David Cohen points out that labeling a child an indigo is an alternative to a diagnosis that implies mental illness, which may appeal to many parents.  Cohen has stated, \"The view in medicine is that ADHD is a defect. It\'s a disorder. If you\'re a parent, the idea of \'gifted\' is much more appealing than the idea of a disorder.\"  Linking the concept of indigo children with the distaste for the use of Ritalin to control ADHD, Robert Todd Carroll states \"The hype and near-hysteria surrounding the use of Ritalin has contributed to an atmosphere that makes it possible for a book like Indigo Children to be taken seriously. Given the choice, who wouldn\'t rather believe their children are special and chosen for some high mission rather than that they have a brain disorder?\"  Stephen Hinshaw, a professor of psychology at the University of California, Berkeley, states that concerns regarding the overmedicalization of children are legitimate but even gifted children with ADHD learn better with more structure rather than less, even if the structure initially causes difficulties.  Many labeled as indigo children are or have been home schooled. Many children labeled as indigo children have the same identifying criteria as those children who have experienced being raised by a narcissistic parent, and are considered to have been emotionally abused.A 2011 study suggested parents of children with ADHD who label their children as \"indigos\" may perceive problematic behaviors emblematic of ADHD to be more positive and experience less frustration and disappointment, though they still experience more negative emotions and conflicts than parents of children without a diagnosis.\n\n\n=== Relation to autism ===\nCrystal children, a concept related to indigo children, has been linked by autism researcher  Mitzi Waltz to the autistic spectrum.  Proponents recategorize autistic symptoms as telepathic powers, and attempt to \"‍[reconceptualize] the autistic traits associated with them as part of a positive identity\".  Waltz states that there may be inherent dangers to these beliefs, leading parents to deny the existence of impairments, avoid proven treatments and spend considerable money on unhelpful interventions.  Waltz states that \"Parents may also transmit belief systems to the child that are self-aggrandizing, confusing, or potentially frightening\".\n\n\n== Commercialization ==\nThe concept of indigo children has been criticized for being less about children and their needs, and more about the profits to be made by self-styled experts in book and video sales as well as lucrative counseling sessions, summer camps, conferences and speaking engagements.\n\n\n== Discussion as a new religious movement ==\nNancy Ann Tappe originally noted that one type of Indigo child (the \"interdimensional child\"), despite being seen as a bully, was expected to lead new religious movements.One pagan author, Lorna Tedder, anecdotally notes that every pagan woman she knew who had or was going to have a child believed their child was an Indigo child.S. Zohreh Kermani states that \"Despite their problems with authority, uncontrollable tempers, and overbearing egos, Indigo Children are many pagan parents\' ideal offspring: sensitive, psychic, and strong willed\", but also notes the concept is less about the child\'s psychic abilities than the parent\'s own hopes and desire for \"distinction from the less-evolved masses.\"Daniel Kline, in an essay titled \"The New Kids: Indigo Children and New Age Discourse\", notes that the magical belief that the innocence of children equates to spiritual powers has existed for centuries, and that the indigo child movement is rooted in a religious rejection of science-based medicine. In particular, he claims that Nancy Ann Tappe derived some of her ideas from Charles Webster Leadbeater (her main innovation being emphasizing the connection between children and the color indigo), and that the New Age adoption of the concept is a reaction against diagnoses of ADD, ADHD, and autism.  Kline also discusses how Carroll and Tober have tried to distance themselves from religious beliefs about indigo children in order to maintain control of the concept (even recanting their previous affirmations about auras), and how skeptics and New Agers alike both make rhetorical appeals to science (despite the latter\'s rejection of it) to legitimize their ideological beliefs regarding the existence of indigo children.At the 2014 University of Cambridge Festival of Ideas, anthropologist Beth Singler discussed how the term indigo children functioned as a new religious movement, along with Jediism. Singler\'s work focuses in the Indigo movement as a part of an overall discussion on \"wider moral panics around children, parenting, the diagnosis of conditions such as ADHD and autism and conspiracy theories about Big Pharma and vaccinations.\"\n\n\n== See also ==\nIndigo Era (economics)\nNeurodiversity\n\n\n== References ==', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1c/Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg'),
(129, 'Kenneth Arnold UFO sighting', 'The Kenneth Arnold UFO sighting occurred on June 24, 1947, when private pilot Kenneth Arnold claimed that he saw a string of nine, shiny unidentified flying objects flying past Mount Rainier at speeds that Arnold estimated at a minimum of 1,200 miles an hour (1,932 km/hr). This was the first post-War sighting in the United States that garnered nationwide news coverage and is credited with being the first of the modern era of UFO sightings, including numerous reported sightings over the next two to three weeks. Arnold\'s description of the objects also led to the press quickly coining the terms flying saucer and flying disc as popular descriptive terms for UFOs.\n\n\n== Sighting ==\n\nOn June 24, 1947, Arnold was flying from Chehalis, Washington to Yakima, Washington in a CallAir A-2 on a business trip. He made a brief detour after learning of a $5,000 reward (equivalent to $56,000 today) for the discovery of a U.S. Marine Corps C-46 transport airplane that had crashed near Mt. Rainier. The skies were completely clear and there was a mild wind.\nA few minutes before 3:00 p.m. at about 9,200 feet (2,800 m) in altitude and near Mineral, Washington, he gave up his search and started heading eastward towards Yakima. He saw a bright flashing light, similar to sunlight reflecting from a mirror. Afraid he might be dangerously close to another aircraft, Arnold scanned the skies around him, but all he could see was a DC-4 to his left and behind him, about 15 miles (24 km) away.\nAbout 30 seconds after seeing the first flash of light, Arnold saw a series of bright flashes in the distance off to his left, or north of Mt. Rainier, which was then 20 to 25 miles (40 km) away. He thought they might be reflections on his airplane\'s windows, but a few quick tests (rocking his airplane from side to side, removing his eyeglasses, later rolling down his side window) ruled this out. The reflections came from flying objects. They flew in a long chain, and Arnold for a moment considered they might be a flock of geese, but quickly ruled this out for a number of reasons, including the altitude, bright glint, and obviously very fast speed. He then thought they might be a new type of jet and started looking intently for a tail and was surprised that he couldn\'t find any.\nThey quickly approached Rainier and then passed in front, usually appearing dark in profile against the bright white snowfield covering Rainier, but occasionally still giving off bright light flashes as they flipped around erratically. Sometimes he said he could see them on edge, when they seemed so thin and flat they were practically invisible. According to Jerome Clark, Arnold described them as a series of objects with convex shapes, though he later revealed that one object differed by being crescent-shaped. Several years later, Arnold would state he likened their movement to saucers skipping on water, without comparing their actual shapes to saucers, but initial quotes from him do indeed have him comparing the shape to like a \"saucer\", \"disc\", \"pie pan\", or \"half moon\", or generally convex and thin (discussion below). At one point Arnold said they flew behind a subpeak of Rainier and briefly disappeared. Knowing his position and the position of the (unspecified) subpeak, Arnold placed their distance as they flew past Rainier at about 23 miles (37 km).\nUsing a dzus cowling fastener as a gauge to compare the nine objects to the distant DC-4, Arnold estimated their angular size as slightly smaller than the DC-4, about the width between the outer engines (about 60 ft (18 m)). Arnold also said he realized that the objects would have to be quite large to see any details at that distance and later, after comparing notes with a United Airlines crew that had a similar sighting 10 days later (see below), placed the absolute size as larger than a DC-4 airliner (or greater than 100 feet (30 m) in length). Army Air Force analysts would later estimate 140 to 280 feet (85 m), based on analysis of human visual acuity and other sighting details (such as estimated distance).\nArnold said the objects were grouped together, as Ted Bloecher writes, \"in a diagonally stepped-down, echelon formation, stretched out over a distance that he later calculated to be five miles\". Though moving on a more or less level horizontal plane, Arnold said the objects weaved from side to side (\"like the tail of a Chinese kite\" as he later stated), darting through the valleys and around the smaller mountain peaks. They would occasionally flip or bank on their edges in unison as they turned or maneuvered causing almost blindingly bright or mirror-like flashes of light. The encounter gave him an \"eerie feeling\", but Arnold suspected he had seen test flights of a new U.S. military aircraft.\nAs the objects passed Mt Rainer, Arnold turned his plane southward on a more or less parallel course. It was at this point that he opened his side window and began observing the objects unobstructed by any glass that might have produced reflections. The objects did not disappear and continued to move very rapidly southward, continuously moving forward of his position. Curious about their speed, he began to time their rate of passage: he said they moved from Mt. Rainer to Mount Adams where they faded from view, a distance of about 50 miles (80 km), in one minute and forty-two seconds, according to the clock on his instrument panel. When he later had time to do the calculation, the speed was over 1,700 miles per hour (2,700 km/h). This was about three times faster than any manned aircraft in 1947. Not knowing exactly the distance where the objects faded from view, Arnold conservatively and arbitrarily rounded this down to 1,200 miles (1,900 km) an hour, still faster than any known aircraft, which had yet to break the sound barrier. It was this supersonic speed in addition to the unusual saucer or disk description that seemed to capture people\'s attention.\n\n\n=== Arnold shares the story ===\nArnold landed in Yakima at about 4:00 p.m., and quickly told friend and airport general manager Al Baxter the amazing story, and before long, the entire airport staff knew of Arnold\'s claims. He discussed the story with the staff, and later wrote that Baxter didn\'t believe him.\nArnold flew on to an air show in Pendleton, Oregon, not knowing that somebody in Yakima had phoned in ahead to say that Arnold had seen some strange new aircraft. It was at this time that Arnold studied his maps, determined the distance between Mt. Rainier and Mt. Adams, and calculated the rather astonishing speed. He told a number of pilot friends, and wrote in his account to AAF intelligence that they did not scoff or laugh. Instead they suggested that maybe he had seen guided missiles or something new, though Arnold felt this explanation to be inadequate. He also wrote that some former Army pilots told him that they had been briefed before going into combat \"that they might see objects of similar shape and design as I described and assured me that I wasn\'t dreaming or going crazy.\" (See Foo fighter.)\nArnold wasn\'t interviewed by reporters until the next day (June 25) when he went to the office of the East Oregonian in Pendleton. Any skepticism the reporters might have harbored evaporated when they interviewed Arnold at length; as historian Mike Dash records:\nArnold had the makings of a reliable witness. He was a respected businessman and experienced pilot ... and seemed to be neither exaggerating what he had seen, nor adding sensational details to his report. He also gave the impression of being a careful observer ... These details impressed the newspapermen who interviewed him and lent credibility to his report.Arnold would soon complain about the effects of the publicity on his life. On June 27 he was reported saying, \"I haven\'t had a moment of peace since I first told the story.\"  He then said a preacher had called and told him that the objects he saw were \"harbingers of doomsday\" and that the preacher was preparing his congregation \"for the end of the world.\"  In another encounter, a woman in a Pendleton cafe noticed him and dashed out shrieking, \"There\'s the man who saw the men from Mars.\"  She ran out \"sobbing she would have to do something for the children,\" Arnold was reported as saying \"with a shudder\".\nHe then added that, \"This whole thing has gotten out of hand. I want to talk to the FBI or someone. Half the people look at me as a combination of Einstein, Flash Gordon and screwball. I wonder what my wife back in Idaho thinks.\"\n\n\n=== Arnold talks of possible non-earthly origins ===\nOn July 7, 1947, two stories came out where Arnold again was raising the topic of possible extraterrestrial origins, both as his opinion and those who had written to him.  In an Associated Press story, Arnold said he had received quantities of fan mail eager to help solve the mystery, none of it calling him a \"screwball\".  Like the earlier doomsday preacher Arnold spoke of, many of the writers placed a religious interpretation on his sighting.  But others, he said, \"suggested the discs were visitations from another planet.\"  Arnold added he had purchased a movie camera, which he would now take with him on every flight, hoping to obtain photographic proof of what he had seen.In the other story, Arnold was interviewed by the Chicago Times:\n\n\"...Kenneth Luis Arnold ...is not so certain that the strange contraptions are made on this planet.  Arnold... said he hoped the devices were really the work of the U.S. Army.  But he told the TIMES in a phone conversation:  \'If our government knows anything about these devices, the people should be told at once.  A lot of people out here are very much disturbed.  Some think these things may be from another planet.  But they aren\'t harming anyone and I think it would be the wrong thing to shoot one of them down—even if can be done.  Their high speed would completely wreck them…\'\"Arnold, in pointing to the possibility of these discs being from another world, said, regardless of their origin, they apparently were traveling to some reachable destination.  Whoever controlled them, he said, obviously wasn\'t trying to hurt anyone.  …He said discs were making turns so abruptly in rounding peaks that it would have been impossible for human pilots inside to have survived the pressure.  So, he too thinks they are controlled from elsewhere, regardless of whether it\'s from Mars, Venus, or our own planet.\"In an Associated Press story from July 19, Arnold reiterated his belief that if they weren\'t Army, then they were extraterrestrial:\n\n\"The ex-University of Minnesota swimmer and footballer says he now believes:\n1. The disks are not from any foreign country.\n2. The Army could give the answer if it would -- \'if they don\'t have the explanation now they certainly could do something to find out.\'\n3. If the Army has no explanation the disks must be -- \'and I know this sounds crazy\' -- from another planet.\"Arnold would make similar statements when interviewed by journalist Edward R. Murrow in 1950.  (See below)\nIn April 1949, in a skeptical article in the Saturday Evening Post titled \"What You Can Believe About Flying Saucers\", Arnold was likewise quoted:\n\n\"Since my first observations and report of the so-called \'flying disks\' I have spent a great deal of money and time thoroughly investigating the subject... There is no doubt in my mind but what these objects are aircraft of a strange design, and material that is unknown to the civilization of this earth.\"The article goes on to say:\n\nArnold himself has been conducting a one-man campaign to prove that he did see something out of the ordinary that day over Mount Rainier...  Arnold has written other articles for Fate--one titled Phantom Lights Over Nevada, and another Are Space Visitors Here.  In the latter, discussing a fisherman\'s report of seeing weird purplish spheres with portholes maneuvering over the Crown River, in Ontario, Arnold wrote:  \"Once again, we can be sure that these Canadian blue-green-purple globes are not meteors, nor are they fragments of a comet or Venus.  What, then, are they?  Spacecraft from another world?\"Clearly Arnold was early leaning heavily towards the Extraterrestrial hypothesis to explain what he and others had seen.\n\n\n=== Corroboration ===\nArnold\'s sighting was partly corroborated by a prospector named Fred Johnson on Mt. Adams, who wrote AAF intelligence that he saw six of the objects on June 24 at about the same time as Arnold, which he viewed through a small telescope. He said they were \"round\" and tapered \"sharply to a point in the head and in an oval shape.\"  He also noted that the objects seemed to disturb his compass. An evaluation of the witness by AAF intelligence found him to be credible.  Ironically, Johnson\'s report was listed as the first unexplained UFO report in Air Force files, while Arnold\'s was dismissed as a mirage, yet Johnson seemed to be describing a continuation of the same event as Arnold.\nThe Portland Oregon Journal reported on July 4 receiving a letter from an L. G. Bernier of Richland, Washington (about 110 miles (180 km) east of Mt. Adams and 140 miles (230 km) southeast of Mt. Rainier). Bernier wrote that he saw three of the strange objects over Richland flying \"almost edgewise\" toward Mt. Rainier about one half-hour before Arnold. Bernier thought the three were part of a larger formation. He indicated they were traveling at high speed: \"I have seen a P-38 appear seemingly on one horizon and then gone to the opposite horizon in no time at all, but these disks certainly were traveling faster than any P-38. [Maximum speed of a P-38 was about 440 miles an hour.]  No doubt Mr. Arnold saw them just a few minutes or seconds later, according to their speed.\"  The previous day, Bernier had also spoken to his local newspaper, the Richland Washington Villager, and was among the first witnesses to suggest extraterrestrial origins:  \"I believe it may be a visitor from another planet.\"About 60 miles (97 km) west-northwest of Richland in Yakima, Washington, a woman named Ethel Wheelhouse likewise reported sighting several flying discs moving at fantastic speeds at around the same time as Arnold\'s sighting.When military intelligence began investigating Arnold\'s sighting in early July (see below), they found yet another witness from the area.  A member of the Washington State forest service, who had been on fire watch at a tower in Diamond Gap, about 20 miles (32 km) south of Yakima, reported seeing \"flashes\" at 3:00 p.m. on the 24th over Mount Rainier (or exactly the same time as Arnold\'s sighting), that appeared to move in a straight line. Similarly, at 3:00 p.m. Sidney B. Gallagher in Washington state (exact position unspecified) reported seeing nine shiny discs flash by to the north.A Seattle newspaper also mentioned a woman near Tacoma who said she saw a chain of nine, bright objects flying at high speed near Mt. Rainier. Unfortunately this short news item wasn\'t precise as to time or date, but indicated it was around the same date as Arnold\'s sighting.\nHowever, a pilot of a DC-4 some 10 to 15 miles (24 km) north of Arnold en route to Seattle reported seeing nothing unusual. (This was the same DC-4 seen by Arnold and which he used for size comparison.)\nOther Seattle area newspapers also reported other sightings of flashing, rapidly moving unknown objects on the same day, but not the same time, as Arnold\'s sighting. Most of these sightings were over Seattle or west of Seattle in the town of Bremerton, either that morning or at night.  Altogether, there were at least 16 other reported UFO sightings the same day as Arnold\'s in the Washington state area. maptable of Washington state sightings\n\n\n=== The flap continues ===\n\nThe primary corroborative sighting, however, occurred ten days later (July 4) when a United Airlines crew over Idaho en route to Seattle also spotted five to nine disk-like objects that paced their plane for 10 to 15 minutes before suddenly disappearing. The next day in Seattle, Arnold met with the pilot, Cpt. Emil J. Smith, and copilot and compared sighting details. The main difference in shape was that the United crew thought the objects appeared rough on top. This was one of the few sightings that Arnold felt was reliable, most of the rest he thought were the public seeing other things and letting their imaginations run wild. Arnold and Cpt. Smith became friends, met again with Army Air Force intelligence officers on July 12 and filed sighting reports, then teamed up again at the end of July in investigating the strange Maury Island incident.\nA similar sighting of eight objects also occurred over Tulsa, Oklahoma on July 12, 1947. In this instance, a photo was taken and published in the Tulsa Daily World the following day (photo at right). The photographer, Enlo Gilmore, said that in blowups of the photo, the objects resembled baseball catcher\'s mitts or flying wings. He was of the opinion that the military had a secret fleet of flying wing airplanes. He had been a gunnery officer in the Navy during the war, and using information from another witness, also a veteran, he performed a triangulation and arrived at an estimation of speed of 1,700 miles per hour (2,700 km/h), or essentially the same estimate as Arnold\'s. One of the objects, he said, seemed to have a hole in the middle.[7]\nTwo or three photos of a similar, solitary object were taken by William Rhodes over Phoenix, Arizona on July 7, 1947, and appeared in a local Phoenix newspaper and some other newspapers. The object was rounded in front with a crescent back. These photos also seem to show something resembling a hole in the middle, though Rhodes thought it was a canopy.[8]  Rhodes\'s negatives and prints were later confiscated by the FBI and military. However, the photos show up in later Air Force intelligence reports.[9]\nArnold was soon shown the Rhodes photos when he met with two AAF intelligence officers. He commented, \"It was a disk almost identical to the one peculiar flying saucer that had been worrying me since my original observation — the one that looked different from the rest and that I had never mentioned to anyone.\"  As a result, Arnold felt that the Rhodes photos were genuine.\n\n\n== Publicity and origins of term \"flying saucer\" ==\nArnold\'s account was first featured in a few late newspaper editions on June 25, appeared in numerous U.S. and Canadian papers (and some foreign newspapers) on June 26 and thereafter, often on the front page. Without exception, according to Bloecher, the Arnold story was initially related with a serious, even-handed tone.   The first reporters to interview Arnold were Nolan Skiff and Bill Bequette of the East Oregonian in Pendleton, Oregon on June 25, and the first story on the Arnold sighting, written by Bequette, appeared in the newspaper the same day.\n\n\n=== The term appears ===\nStarting June 26 and June 27, newspapers first began using the terms \"flying saucer\" and \"flying disk\" (or \"disc\") to describe the sighted objects. Thus the Arnold sighting is credited with giving rise to these popular terms. The actual origin of the terms is somewhat controversial and complicated. Jerome Clark cites a 1970 study by Herbert Strentz, who reviewed U.S. newspaper accounts of the Arnold UFO sighting, and concluded that the term was probably due to an editor or headline writer: the body of the early Arnold news stories did not use the term \"flying saucer\" or \"flying disc.\"  However, earlier stories did in fact credit Arnold with using terms such as \"saucer\", \"disk\", and \"pie-pan\" in describing the shape. (see quotations further below)\n\n\n=== Bequette interview ===\nYears later, Arnold claimed he told Bill Bequette that \"they flew erratic, like a saucer if you skip it across the water.\" Arnold felt that he had been misquoted since the description referred to the objects\' motion rather than their shape. Thus Bequette has often been credited with first using \"flying saucer\" and supposedly misquoting Arnold, but the term does not appear in Bequette\'s early articles. Instead, his first article of June 25 says only, \"He said he sighted nine saucer-like aircraft flying in formation...\"The next day in a much more detailed article, Bequette wrote, \"He clung to his story of shiny, flat objects racing over the Cascade mountains with a peculiar weaving motion \'like the tail of a Chinese kite.\' ...He also described the objects as \'saucer-like\' and their motion \'like fish flipping in the sun.\' ...[Arnold] described the objects as \'flat like a pie-pan and somewhat bat-shaped\'.\" It wasn\'t until June 28 that Bequette first used the term \"flying disc\" (but not \"flying saucer\").\nA review of early newspaper stories indicates that immediately after his sighting, Arnold generally described the objects\' shape as thin and flat, rounded in the front but chopped in the back and coming to a point, i.e., more or less saucer- or disk-like. He also specifically used terms like \"saucer\" or \"saucer-like\", \"disk\", and \"pie pan\" or \"pie plate\" in describing the shape. The motion he generally described as weaving like the tail of a kite and erratic flipping.\nFor example, in a surviving recorded radio interview from June 26, 1947 made by reporter Ted Smith, United Press correspondent in Pendleton, and aired on KWRC, the local radio station of Pendleton, Arnold described them as looking \"something like a pie plate that was cut in half with a sort of a convex triangle in the rear.\"  His motion descriptions were:  \"I noticed to the left of me a chain which looked to me like the tail of a Chinese kite, kind of weaving... they seemed to flip and flash in the sun, just like a mirror... they seemed to kind of weave in and out right above the mountaintops...\"  [10]\n\n\n=== Subsequent quotes ===\nThe following day (June 26) were the following quotations attributed to Arnold: [11]\n\nUnited Press:  \"They were shaped like saucers and were so thin I could barely see them...\"\nAssociated Press:  \"He said they were bright, saucer-like objects--he called them \'aircraft\'.  ...He also described the objects as \'saucer-like\' and their motion \'like a fish flipping in the sun.\'  ...Arnold described the objects as \'flat like a pie pan\'.\"\nAssociated Press: \"They flew with a peculiar dipping motion, \'like a fish flipping in the sun,\' he said. ... He said they appeared to fly almost as if fastened together -- if one dipped, the others did, too.\"\nChicago Tribune:  \"They were silvery and shiny and seemed to be shaped like a pie plate.... I am sure they were separate units because they weaved in flight like the tail of a kite.\"On June 27 was the following quotation:\n\nPortland Oregon Journal:  \"\'They were half-moon shaped, oval in front and convex in the rear.   ...There were no bulges or cowlings; they looked like a big flat disk.\' ...Arnold said that the objects weaved \'like the tail of a Chinese kite\'.\"Two weeks later, Arnold was still referring to the shape of the objects as \"saucers\" or \"saucer-like.\"  In the Portland Oregonian on July 11, he was quoted saying, \"I actually saw a type of aircraft slightly longer than it was wide, with a thickness about one twentieth as great as its width. ...I reckoned the saucers were 23 miles away.\"\n\n\n=== Statement to the army ===\n\nIn a written statement to Army Air Forces (AAF) intelligence the following day (July 12), Arnold several times referred to the objects as \"saucer-like.\" At the end of the report he drew a picture of what the objects appeared to look like at their closest approach to Mt. Rainier. He wrote, \"They seemed longer than wide, their thickness was about 1/20th their width.\" (document with Arnold\'s drawing at right)  As to motion, Arnold wrote, \"They flew like many times I have observed geese to fly in a rather diagonal chain-like line as if they were linked together. They seemed to hold a definite direction but rather swerved in and out of the high mountain peaks.\" He also spoke of how they would \"flip and flash in the sun.\" text of written report\n\n\n=== A variant object ===\nTo complicate the shape descriptions further, a month after his sighting, Arnold was to become involved in the bizarre Maury Island incident. Arnold was dispatched by a magazine publisher to Tacoma to investigate it, although he eventually turned the investigation over to the AAF. In a meeting with two AAF intelligence officers (the same ones who interviewed him on July 12 and for whom he wrote his report), Arnold first revealed one of the nine objects was different, being larger and shaped more like a crescent coming to a point in the back. It was at this time that Arnold was also shown the Rhodes photos of a crescent-shaped object over Phoenix, which Arnold deemed authentic because of the unusual shape.\nSome note the object in the drawing bears an uncanny similarity to the WW2 German design, the Horten Ho 229, sometimes further claiming it was captured German technology being tested. But there is no historical evidence of any kind supporting this.\n\n\n== Widespread UFO reports after Arnold sighting ==\nIn the weeks that followed Arnold\'s June 1947 story, at least several hundred reports of similar sightings flooded in from the U.S. and around the world—most of which described saucer-shaped objects. A sighting by a United Airlines crew of another nine disk-like objects over Idaho on July 4 probably garnered more newspaper coverage than Arnold\'s original sighting, and opened the floodgates of media coverage in the days to follow.\nBloecher collected reports of 853 flying disc sightings that year from 140 newspapers from Canada, Washington D.C, and every U.S. state save Montana. This was more UFO reports for 1947 than most researchers ever suspected. Some of these stories were poorly documented or fragmentary, but Bloecher argued that about 250 of the more detailed reports (such as those made by pilots or scientists, multiple eyewitnesses, or backed by photos) made a persuasive case for a genuine mystery.\nAdding intrigue to Arnold\'s story, the U.S. military denied having any planes at all in the area of Mount Rainier at the time of his sighting. Likewise, on July 6, speculation arose in newspaper articles that the objects being sighted were due to either the \"flying wing\" or \"flying flapjack\", a disc-shaped aircraft, both experimental planes under development by the U.S. military at the time. The military repeated that neither aircraft could account for the sightings, which is also borne out by historical records.The most famous UFO event during this period was the Roswell UFO incident, the alleged military recovery of a crashed flying disk, the story of which broke on July 8, 1947. To calm rising public concern, this and other cases were debunked by the military in succeeding days as mistaken sightings of weather balloons. Just before the Roswell story came out, the Army Air Forces in Washington issued a press statement saying they had the matter under investigation and had decided the flying discs definitely were not \"secret bacteriological weapons designed by some foreign power\", \"new-type army rockets\", or \"space ships\".\n\n\n== Military investigation of Arnold story ==\nThe first investigation of Arnold\'s claims came from Lt. Frank Brown and Capt. William Davidson of Hamilton Field in California, who interviewed Arnold on July 12. Arnold also submitted a written report at that time. Regarding the reliability of Arnold\'s sighting, they concluded:\n\n\"It is the present opinion of the interviewer that Mr. Arnold actually saw what he stated he saw. It is difficult to believe that a man of [his] character and apparent integrity would state that he saw objects and write up a report to the extent that he did if he did not see them.\"Despite this, the Army Air Force\'s formal public conclusion was that Arnold had seen a mirage.\nIn addition, on July 9 AAF intelligence, with help from the FBI, secretly began an investigation of the best sightings, mostly from pilots and military personnel. Arnold\'s sighting, as well as that of the United Airline\'s crew, were included in the list of best sightings. Three weeks later they came to the conclusion that the saucer reports were not imaginary or adequately explained by natural phenomena; something real was flying around. This laid the groundwork for another intelligence estimate in September 1947 by Gen. Nathan Twining, commanding officer of the Air Materiel Command, which likewise concluded the saucers were real and urged a formal investigation by multiple government agencies. This in turn resulted in the formation of Project Sign at the end of 1947, the first publicly acknowledged USAF UFO investigation. Project Sign eventually evolved into Project Grudge, and then the better known Project Blue Book.\nThe personnel of the U.S. Air Force\'s Project Sign (1947–1949) also later studied Arnold\'s story. According to Major Edward J. Ruppelt,\n\nI found that there was a lot of speculation on this report [amongst Sign personnel]. Two factions ... joined up behind two lines of reasoning. One side said that Arnold had seen plain, everyday jet airplanes flying in formation ... The other side didn\'t buy this idea at all. They based their argument on the fact that Arnold knew where the objects were when he timed them ...There was an old theory that maybe Arnold had seen wind whipping snow along the mountain ridges, so I asked Air Force investigators about this. I got a flat \"Impossible.\"\n\n\n== Skeptical explanations ==\nSteuart Campbell has said that the objects Arnold reported could have been mirages of several snow-capped peaks in Cascade Range. Campbell\'s calculation of the objects\' speed determined that they were travelling at roughly the same speed as Arnold\'s plane, indicating that the objects were in fact stationary. Mirages could have been caused by temperature inversions over several deep valleys in the line of sight.Philip J. Klass cited an article by Keay Davidson of the San Francisco Examiner in arguing that Arnold might have misidentified meteors on June 24, 1947.\nJames Easton was the first of several skeptics to suggest that Arnold may have misidentified pelicans: the birds live in the Washington region, are rather large (wingspans of over 9.8 ft (3 m) are not uncommon), have a pale underside that can reflect light, can fly at rather high altitudes, and can appear to have a somewhat crescent-shaped profile when flying.\nIn response to skeptical explanations, Bruce Maccabee says a meteor theory would require impossibly slow speeds and durations for brightly glowing meteors on a horizontal trajectory. He says it is impossible for a bird to be as bright as reported by Arnold, and that birds—which could not fly as fast as Arnold\'s plane—would have steadily moved backward, not forwards, relative to his position. However Maccabee does not take into account the Occam\'s Razor point of view: pilots at that elevation often suffer from oxygen deprivation hallucinations if their aircraft are not properly sealed; at certain angles birds, especially wet ones, can shine quite brightly, and Arnold probably did not accurately see the movement of the objects because of the problems associated with clear views of parallel objects seen from a plane at that altitude. In short, logic suggests many simpler explanations. Since he saw crescent-shaped objects (not actually saucer shaped), and since pelicans are seen that way and fly in formation at that level, skeptics feel that a flock of pelicans--who migrate in that area at that time of year in that direction--is the most likely explanation.\n\n\n=== Donald Menzel\'s explanations ===\nDonald Menzel was a Harvard astronomer and one of the earliest UFO debunkers. Over the years, he offered several possible explanations for the Arnold\'s 1947 UFO sighting. Bruce Maccabee disputed Menzel\'s explanations in a 1986 monograph.\nIn 1953, Menzel suggested that Arnold had seen clouds of snow blown from the mountains south of Mt. Rainier. According to Maccabee, such snow clouds have hazy light, not the mirror-like brilliance reported by Arnold. Further, such clouds could not be in the rapid motion reported by Arnold, nor would they account for Arnold first seeing the bright objects north of Rainier.\nIn 1963, Menzel proposed that Arnold had seen orographic clouds or wave clouds; Maccabee says that this conflicted with testimony from Arnold and others that the sky was clear, and again can\'t account for the objects\' reported brightness and rapid motion over a very large angular region.\nIn 1971, Menzel said that Arnold may have merely seen spots of water on his airplane\'s windows; Maccabee says that this contradicts Arnold\'s testimony that he had specifically ruled out water spots or reflections shortly after seeing the nine UFOs. For example, the early Bill Bequette article of June 26 in the East Oregonian has Arnold saying he at first thought that maybe he was seeing reflections off his window, but \"he still saw the objects after rolling it down.\"\n\n\n== Other sightings by Arnold and his opinion ==\nIn a 1950 interview with journalist Edward R. Murrow, Arnold reported seeing similar objects on three other occasions, and said other pilots flying in the northwestern U.S. had sighted such objects as many as eight times. The pilots initially felt a duty reporting the objects despite the ridicule, he said, because they thought the U.S. government didn\'t know what they were. Arnold did not assert that the objects were alien spacecraft, although he did say: \"being a natural-born American, if it\'s not made by our science or our Army Air Forces, I am inclined to believe it\'s of an extraterrestrial origin.\" Then he added that he thought everybody should be concerned, but \"I don\'t think it\'s anything for people to get hysterical about.\"\nThe first issue of Fate (1948) featured the article The Truth About The Flying Saucers by Arnold. In 1952 he described his experiences in the book The Coming of the Saucers, which he and a publisher friend named Raymond A. Palmer published themselves.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of UFO sightings\nUFO\nBabylonokia\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Singular Adventure of Mr Kenneth Arnold\nThe Positively True Story of Kenneth Arnold - Part One 10-part series at Saturday Night Uforia\nOut of This World: 60 Years of Flying Saucers by Nigel Watson\nThe most complete Arnold sighting description and analysis on the net\nResolving Arnold part 1\nResolving Arnold part 2\nTranscript of telephone conversation with Arnold by Edward R.

(131, 'Maury Island incident', 'The Maury Island Incident, June 21 1947, refers to claims made by Fred Crisman and Harold Dahl of falling debris and threats by men in black following sightings of unidentified flying objects in the sky over Maury Island in Puget Sound. \n\n\n== Incident and Immediate Aftermath ==\nMost of what is speculated comes from a report by Kenneth Arnold, an aviator who had claimed to see several UFOs in the area around that time, in the first UFO sightings ever recorded.Crisman and Dahl claimed to Arnold that they were harbor patrolmen on a workboat near Maury Island and that they saw six doughnut-shaped objects in the sky. According to Crisman and Dahl, one of the objects dropped a substance that resembled lava or \"white metal\" onto their boat, breaking a worker\'s arm and killing a dog. Dahl also claimed he was later approached by a man in a dark suit and told not to talk about the incident. While even the claim that Chrisman and Dahl were harbor patrolmen is now believed to be false, Arnold was convinced by their story and contacted an Air Force intelligence officer, who flew in along with another from California. The officers concluded the metal objects were aluminum and not of interest. They did not reveal this to Arnold, however, to avoid embarrassing him. The officers then died in a crash on their way back to California.The FBI then proceeded to investigate this case, and concluded that Crisman and Dahl\'s sightings were a hoax. In their files, they noted that Dahl stated that \"if questioned by the authorities he was going to say it was a hoax because he did not want any further trouble over the matter.\" The files also detail a few alternate stories communicated by Crisman and Dahl to local newspapers and other media outlets, and conclude that they had contacted a variety of publications \"in the hope of building up their story through publicity to a point where they could make a profitable deal with Fantasy Magazine, Chicago, Illinois.\"\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nRaymond A. Palmer, who is often credited with inventing the concept of the UFO, began Fate Magazine in 1948 with a cover story by Arnold on his investigation of the Maury incident as well as his nearby alleged UFO sightings. The pair also went on to write the book The Coming of the Saucers. The story was later retold in Gray Barker\'s 1956 book \"They Knew Too Much About Flying Saucers,\" which helped to popularize the image of \"Men In Black\" in mainstream culture.An account also appeared in the debunked Majestic 12 documents, which claim that the metal fragments were part of a nuclear reactor and that they were subsequently turned over to the CIA. Craig Glenday also cited the Maury Island Incident, along with the Arnold sightings, in his 1999 book The UFO Investigator\'s Handbook as a notable UFO incident surrounding Mount Rainer, which he described as a \"UFO laborator[y]\".Dahl\'s story was told in the 2014 short film \"The Maury Island Incident\".In 2017 the Washington State Senate passed a resolution acknowledging the 70th anniversary of the incident.\n\n\n== See also ==\nKenneth Arnold\nRaymond A.

(132, '1972 UFO sightings in the eastern Cape', 'This is a list of alleged sightings of unidentified flying objects or UFOs in South Africa.\n\n\n== 1965 report ==\nAccording to NICAP and Flying Saucer Review magazine, after midnight on 16 September, police constables Lockem and de Klerk observed a shiny, copper-coloured craft which had landed astride the white middle line of the Pretoria–Bronkhorstspruit road, at a spot that was deserted 5 minutes earlier. Their patrol vehicle allegedly cut out as they watched the craft rapidly ascending, while emitting a sea of flames through two portals below. The 30 feet (9.1 m) wide disc, shaped like a spinning top, darted silently in a northwesterly direction, leaving the asphalt ablaze for many minutes afterwards. According to NICAP, the incident was confirmed in a press release by Lt colonel J. B. Brits, district commandant of Pretoria North, but scientists from the C.S.I.R. who were asked to investigate the 6 ft wide, buckled and charred imprint, ridiculed the saucer explanation. Constable Lockem, aided by a staff artist of Die Vaderland newspaper, provided a sketch of the craft. Residents of the East Rand reported an \"enormous white light\" and a \"red ball\" in their skies earlier that night.\n\n\n== 1970s sightings ==\nIn 1972, Bennie Smith, the owner of a farm near Fort Beaufort in the eastern Cape region of South Africa, says he fired shots at an unknown object hovering at treetop height after a worker named Boer de Klerk alerted him to it. Smith believed his shots were accurately aimed, but had no effect. Police sergeant Piet Kitching and police station commander Van Rensburg stated they arrived and fired shots at the object, described as metallic and shaped like a 44-gallon drum with three legs that changed colors before it flew away. They said they found imprints and markings on the ground they believed were made by the object. It is claimed that the Grahamstown army regiment investigated the site, but the base has no records of such an event. The incident received coverage by international press, and led to businesses capitalizing on the incident, with a tavern calling itself the \"UFO Bar\" and painting flying saucers on the walls and the local Savoy Hotel keeping clippings of the stories posted on its walls. In a humorous editorial, the New Scientist stated the apartheid South African government was \"very fastidious about the sort of immigrants she welcomes and little green men may very well be on the prohibited list\".\nOn the evening of 12 November 1972 four soldiers at the Rosmead military camp in the eastern Cape, observed a rotating set of red lights near their duty room, but these went out before they could investigate. When headmaster Harold Truter arrived about 10 minutes later at Rosmead Junior School, he observed an unusual light hovering silently over a nearby ridge, which was casting an oblique beam to the ground. A \'flickering glow\' over the school\'s locked tennis court caused him to investigate. Broken and molten asphalt and different sets of symmetrically placed imprints were found, subsequently considered to be a UFO landing site. Additional asphalt fragments were found strewn 183 m away on a nearby ridge, and nearby Eucalypt trees were badly scorched and soon died. Additional UFO sightings were claimed from the vicinity.\nOn 31 July 1975 Danie Van Graan, the owner of a farm near Loxton, at 7.50 saw a oval shaped object with rounded windows on the ground. Inside the object he could see four humanoid beings. As he approached, a beam of light was shone on his face and his nose bled. After some minutes the UFO took off.\nOn 29 September 1978 a resident Indian woman reported a disc-shaped object taking off from the Groendal Nature Reserve near Uitenhage, eastern Cape. Three days later, on 2 October, four school boys from Despatch, aged 12 to 16, observed three silvery-clad men in the reserve while hiking. Two of the men arrived from the direction of a shining object, and joined a third to ascend a steep incline on what seemed to be fins, before all disappeared. A set of 9 regular imprints found a month later, was deemed related to the reflective object.\n\n\n== 1991 to 2000 ==\nOn 7 April 1991, at 23:15 pm a hovering triangular craft with red central light, and white star-like lights on each extremity, was observed by a family at Baviaanspoort, Pretoria. A similar craft was sighted in the nearby Eersterust township on the evenings of 8 and 9 April, either stationary or moving. Around the same time in Belgium, the same or a similar craft was sighted.\nOn 18 November 1993, at 10:15 pm, Messrs du Plessis and Venter, residents of Sasolburg, observed a craft arriving from the direction of Vereeniging. The craft departed in a flash in the direction of Parys, but returned some three minutes later. The craft, similar in appearance to a water droplet, was observed to change colour and shape. With time individual lights were distinguished, and the body was determined to be cigar-shaped. While contained in a yellowish to orange glow, it emitted a downward blue light, before once again departing in a flash, upwards.  A nearby town resident claimed to have found imprints of a small craft\'s landing gear, some two months later.\nIn September and October 1994 a farmer at Warrenton claimed to have made repeated observations of a noisy, nighttime craft travelling at great speeds, besides what he described as a \'mothership\'. The craft\'s noise was compared to the sound of a helicopter or Volkswagen Beetle engine. The farmer\'s general claims were supported by four independent observers.\nA UFO flap swept South Africa from late March to mid April 1995, which was widely reported in the media. A farmer, Jan Pienaar, reported a landed craft south of Coligny.\nAt 4:00 am on 28 August 1996 a glowing disc was sighted by sergeant Becker near the Adriaan Vlok police station, Erasmuskloof, Pretoria. The pulsating light contained a red triangle and emitted bright green tentacles, while a radar operator at Johannesburg International confirmed its presence. A chase ensued involving some 200 policemen and a police helicopter. The helicopter chase was given up at 10,000 ft near Bronkhorstspruit, when the object made a vertical ascent. An object was sighted again during the early hours of 31 August and 1 September. See also: Petrozavodsk phenomenon.\nAround the end of July 1997 a hovering, cylindrical light or shiny cloud, was filmed by Andreas Mathios in the sky above the town of Trichardt, in the current western Mpumalanga province. Besides Mathios, it was independently observed by three other persons around 6:50am. The light suddenly dropped and rose again before disappearing. Sasol 2 and 3 allegedly had a temporary power outage that morning. Andreas Mathios phoned air traffic control to get information of any objects over the airspaceTrichardt was also the scene of a 1985 sighting.\nOn 27 December 1998 the Laubscher family videotaped a group of roundish triangular craft passing over the town of Graaff Reinet, at about 25,000 ft. These were changing colour and sometimes circled one another, before being overtaken by a much larger, shiny, gold-coloured craft. At this point all the objects departed to a cloud bank on the horizon.\nIn September 1997 Frank Valentyn (and apparently other motorists) observed an enormous stationary tower of about a dozen stacked discs from the N1 freeway in Pretoria. He suspected that those below were \"daughter discs\" released by the \"mothership\" above, which he estimated to be 1.7 kilometres (1.1 mi) in diameter. The lowest disc in the stack would detach and depart in a seemingly random direction at regular intervals, and each disc had a set of orange lights around its perimeter. He reported his observation to the Johannesburg Planetarium.\nOn 8 May 2000, at 3:24am, police inspector Kriel claimed to have observed an approaching UFO while travelling on the N3 freeway, 70 km north of Warden in the eastern Free State province. The orange, oval-shaped light was fitted with two cupolas, one above and another below, and was wide enough to cover four lanes of the freeway. After a close approach the craft receded again. A follow up report claimed that the vicinity is known for moving light apparitions.\n\n\n== 21st century ==\nOn 27 June 2004, Roshnie Naidu observed and video-taped a very bright, colourful light that was suspended near her home in Durban for 3 hours. She was able to alert family members and neighbours to its presence, and observed it changing shape from circular to oval.\nIn 2009 two formations of high-flying, orange-red objects, were seen by many witnesses, and video-recorded by some, as they travelled between the towns of Middelburg and Witbank, 25 kilometres (16 mi) apart. The first formation of 7 objects were seen at 21:51 on 27 February, as they flew westwards from Middelburg towards Witbank. Due to their altitude they eventually disappeared behind clouds. At 20:00 on 6 March, they were noted again high in the sky, but this time greater in number, 23, and traveling in the opposite direction.\nOn the evenings of 21 and 22 July 2010, residents of Booysens, Pretoria, observed a triangle of bright lights which hung motionless in the sky for two hours. In each instance the object commenced a slow descent towards the horizon at 20:30. Binocular observation revealed nothing more than a blue and emerald light, with a white light which shone straight downwards.\nOn the evenings of 11, 20 and 21 May 2011, a host of silent, orange lights with consistent luminosity were observed as they travelled faster than a commercial aeroplane over Tierpoort near Pretoria (some 20 objects) and Krugersdorp respectively. On 15 June seven of these objects were observed and some photographed as they crossed the sky in single file over Tierpoort. At 22:00 on 30 October 2011, a Mr van Greuning photographed two of the five silent fireballs which he observed traveling southwards in low cloud near the town of Harrismith.\nA reported UFO was spotted in Cape Town on the evening of 28 November 2015. Social media was abuzz with various reports of what seemed to be a green light over the city.\n\n\n== Abduction scenarios ==\n\n\n=== 1956 contactee ===\n\nA well-known photo series depicting a supposed UFO was taken on 24 July near Rosetta in the Drakensberg region. The photographer, meteorologist Elizabeth Klarer, claimed detailed adventures with an alien race, besides having had an alien lover, Akon, who would have fathered her son Ayling.\n\n\n=== 1974 abduction event ===\nTravellers Peter and Frances MacNorman claimed an abduction event on 31 May, which would have started near Fort Victoria in the current southern Zimbabwe, and which would have continued to the vicinity of Beitbridge on the South African border.\n\n\n=== 1979 Mindalore incident ===\nOn January 3, 1979, a mother and her 12-year-old son of Mindalore, Krugersdorp, both claimed an encounter with a group of human-like entities standing beside a craft. One of them would have encouraged her to depart with them permanently. After she refused, they would have entered the craft which shortly shot upwards and disappeared in 30 seconds.\n\n\n== Crash claims and hoaxes ==\n\n\n=== 1982 Mozambican border crash ===\nA person identifying himself only as an apartheid era brigadier general of the South African Army claimed in a 2004 Coast to Coast AM interview with Art Bell, that he was an eye-witness to a crashed disc in November 1982. From a Pretoria air force base, he would have given the order to a Mirage pilot flying hundreds of miles to the east, to fire on a suspected MiG aircraft, that was deemed a risk to ground troops. It allegedly turned out to be a disc, which was brought down very near the Mozambican border. He and his special operations team would have retrieved the 12 feet (3.7 m) wide craft holding two comatose grey beings, and returned these to Pretoria. The supposed artifacts were briefly held at Ysterplaat, Cape Town, before allegedly flown to Andrews Field near Washington, D.C., where U.S. officials took custody. Similar, but evidently baseless reports, have been tied to earlier and later dates.\n\n\n=== 1989 Kalahari crash ===\nAccording to supposed leaked documents an alien craft was shot down by South African aircraft, some 80 miles (130 kilometres) into Botswana, on 7 May. Two alien beings were claimed to have been captured on site. To date no primary witnesses have been traced, while the supporting documents, some obvious fakes, were all obtained from James van Greunen. Researcher Tony Dodd lent Van Greunen some credibility in Quest magazine, but other researchers were highly skeptical. The claims have nonetheless been widely circulated, either as fact or as a case deserving investigation.\n\n\n=== 1995 Lesotho crash ===\nAccording to supposed leaked documents an alien craft crashed in Lesotho on 15 September. It was claimed that South African forces retrieved the craft and took three alien beings captive. The source of these documents is unknown, but is once again suspected to be James van Greunen. Failing to trace any key individuals or witnesses, researcher Michael Hesemann denounced it as \'a complete hoax\'. Other researchers, though skeptical, held out hope to trace witnesses.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of reported UFO sightings\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nScans of Cynthia Hind\'s UFO Afrinews\nUfoRSA, UFO research of South Africa', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0c/Red_pog.svg'),
(133, 'Allagash abductions', 'The Allagash Abduction is a purported UFO sighting and alien abduction claimed to have occurred in Allagash, Maine, United States in 1976. One of the participants described it as \"brilliant storytelling\" while the other three members of the group stand by their alien abduction claim.\n\n\n== Claims ==\nBrothers Jim Weiner and Jack Weiner with friends Charles Foltz and Charles Rak claimed that they were abducted by aliens during a camping trip in Allagash, Maine on August 20, 1976. According to the four men, hypnotic regression enabled them to recall being taken aboard a circular UFO and being \"probed and tested by four-fingered beings with almond-shaped eyes and languid limbs\".In a later interview by the St. John Valley Times, Charles Rak changed his story, saying he saw strange lights during the camping trip, but the abduction part of the story was a total fabrication, and he went along with the narrative for financial gain. The other three members of the group stand by the abduction story. According to Jim Weiner, “Jack, Charlie, and I, after all these years, are still in agreement with the Eagle Lake event as we (three) remember it. We also accept the results of the hypnotic regression sessions and subsequent polygraph tests as supportive of an abduction scenario\".\n\n\n== Popular culture ==\nThe incident was the subject of a book, The Allagash Abductions by Raymond E.

(134, 'Crop circle', 'A crop circle or crop formation is a pattern created by flattening a crop, usually a cereal. The term was first coined in the early 1980s by Colin Andrews. Crop circles have been described as all falling \"within the range of the sort of thing done in hoaxes\" by Taner Edis, professor of physics at Truman State University. Although obscure natural causes or alien origins of crop circles are suggested by fringe theorists, there is no scientific evidence for such explanations, and all crop circles are consistent with human causation. A person who studies crop circles is known as a cereologist.\nThe number of crop circles has substantially increased from the 1970s to current times. There has been little scientific study of them. Circles in the United Kingdom are not distributed randomly across the landscape but appear near roads, areas of medium to dense population and cultural heritage monuments, such as Stonehenge or Avebury. In 1991, two hoaxers, Bower and Chorley, took credit for having created many circles throughout England after one of their circles was described by a circle investigator as impossible to be made by human hand.Formations are usually created overnight, although some are reported to have appeared during the day. In contrast to crop circles or crop formations, archaeological remains can cause cropmarks in the fields in the shapes of circles and squares, but they do not appear overnight, and they are always in the same places every year.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe concept of \"crop circles\" began with the original late-1970s hoaxes by Doug Bower and Dave Chorley (see Bower and Chorley, below). They said that they were inspired by the Tully \"saucer nest\" case in Australia, where a farmer claimed to first have seen a UFO, then found a flattened circle of swamp reeds.\n\n\n=== Before the 20th century ===\nA 1678 news pamphlet The Mowing-Devil: or, Strange News Out of Hartfordshire is claimed by some cereologists to be the first depiction of a crop circle. Crop circle researcher Jim Schnabel does not consider it to be a historical precedent because it describes the stalks as being cut rather than bent (see folklore section).\nIn 1686, British naturalist Robert Plot reported on rings or arcs of mushrooms (see fairy rings) in The Natural History of Stafford-Shire and proposed air flows from the sky as a cause. In 1991 meteorologist Terence Meaden linked this report with modern crop circles, a claim that has been compared with those made by Erich von Däniken.An 1880 letter to the editor of Nature by amateur scientist John Rand Capron describes how a recent storm had created several circles of flattened crops in a field.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\nIn 1932, archaeologist E C Curwen observed four dark rings in a field at Stoughton Down near Chichester, but could examine only one: \"a circle in which the barley was \'lodged\' or beaten down, while the interior area was very slightly mounded up.\"In 1963, amateur astronomer Patrick Moore described a crater in a potato field in Wiltshire, which he considered was probably caused by an unknown meteoric body. In nearby wheat fields, there were several circular and elliptical areas where the wheat had been flattened. There was evidence of \"spiral flattening\". He thought they could be caused by air currents from the impact, since they led towards the crater. Astronomer Hugh Ernest Butler observed similar craters and said they were likely caused by lightning strikes.In the 1960s, in Tully, Queensland, Australia, and in Canada, there were many reports of UFO sightings and circular formations in swamp reeds and sugar cane fields. For example, on 8 August 1967, three circles were found in a field in Duhamel, Alberta, Canada; Department of National Defence investigators concluded that it was artificial but couldn\'t say who made them or how. The most famous case is the 1966 Tully \"saucer nest\", when a farmer said he witnessed a saucer-shaped craft rise 30 or 40 feet (12 m) from a swamp and then fly away. On investigating he found a nearly circular area 32 feet long by 25 feet wide where the grass was flattened in clockwise curves to water level within the circle, and the reeds had been uprooted from the mud. The local police officer, the Royal Australian Air Force, and the University of Queensland concluded that it was most probably caused by natural causes, like a down draught, a willy-willy (dust devil), or a waterspout. In 1973, G.J. Odgers, Director of Public Relations, Department of Defence (Air Office), wrote to a journalist that the \"saucer\" was probably debris lifted by the causing willy-willy. Hoaxers Bower and Chorley said they were inspired by this case to start making the modern crop circles that appear today.Since the 1960s, there had been a surge of UFOlogists in Wiltshire, and there were rumours of \"saucer nests\" appearing in the area, but they were never photographed. There are other pre-1970s reports of circular formations, especially in Australia and Canada, but they were always simple circles, which could have been caused by whirlwinds. In Fortean Times David Wood reported that in 1940 he had already made crop circles near Gloucestershire using ropes. In 1997, the Oxford English Dictionary recorded the earliest usage of the term \"crop circles\" in a 1988 issue of Journal of Meteorology, referring to a BBC film. The coining of the term \"crop circle\" is attributed to Colin Andrews in the late 1970s or early 1980s.The majority of reports of crop circles have appeared in and spread since the late 1970s as many circles began appearing throughout the English countryside. This phenomenon became widely known in the late 1980s, after the media started to report crop circles in Hampshire and Wiltshire. After Bower\'s and Chorley\'s 1991 statement that they were responsible for many of them, circles started appearing all over the world. To date, approximately 10,000 crop circles have been reported internationally, from locations such as the former Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, Japan, the U.S., and Canada. Sceptics note a correlation between crop circles, recent media coverage, and the absence of fencing and/or anti-trespassing legislation.Although farmers expressed concern at the damage caused to their crops, local response to the appearance of crop circles was often enthusiastic, with locals taking advantage of the increase of tourism and visits from scientists, crop circle researchers, and individuals seeking spiritual experiences. The market for crop-circle interest consequently generated bus or helicopter tours of circle sites, walking tours, T-shirts, and book sales.\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\nSince the start of the 21st century, crop formations have increased in size and complexity, with some featuring as many as 2,000 different shapes and some incorporating complex mathematical and scientific characteristics.The researcher Jeremy Northcote found that crop circles in the UK in 2002 were not spread randomly across the landscape. They tended to appear near roads, areas of medium-to-dense population, and cultural heritage monuments such as Stonehenge or Avebury. He found that they always appeared in areas that were easy to access. This suggests strongly that these crop circles were more likely to be caused by intentional human action than by paranormal activity. Another strong indication of that theory was that inhabitants of the zone with the most circles had a historical tendency for making large-scale formations, including stone circles such as Stonehenge, burial mounds such as Silbury Hill, long barrows such as West Kennet Long Barrow, and white horses in chalk hills.\n\n\n== Bower and Chorley ==\nIn 1991, self-professed pranksters Doug Bower and Dave Chorley made headlines claiming it was they who started the phenomenon in 1978 with the use of simple tools consisting of a plank of wood, rope, and a baseball cap fitted with a loop of wire to help them walk in a straight line. To prove their case they made a circle in front of journalists; a \"cereologist\" (advocate of paranormal explanations of crop circles), Pat Delgado, examined the circle and declared it authentic before it was revealed that it was a hoax. Inspired by Australian crop circle accounts from 1966, Bower and Chorley claimed to be responsible for all circles made prior to 1987, and for more than 200 crop circles in 1978–1991 (with 1000 other circles not being made by them). After their announcement, the two men demonstrated making a crop circle. According to Professor Richard Taylor, \"the pictographs they created inspired a second wave of crop artists. Far from fizzling out, crop circles have evolved into an international phenomenon, with hundreds of sophisticated pictographs now appearing annually around the globe.\"Smithsonian magazine wrote:\n\nSince Bower and Chorley’s circles appeared, the geometric designs have escalated in scale and complexity, as each year teams of anonymous circle-makers lay honey traps for New Age tourists.\n\n\n== Art and business ==\n\nSince the early 1990s, the UK arts collective Circlemakers, founded by artists Rod Dickinson and John Lundberg (and subsequently including artists Wil Russell and Rob Irving), have been creating crop circles in the UK and around the world as part of their art practice and for commercial clients.The Led Zeppelin boxed set that was released on 7 September 1990, along with the remasters of the first boxed set, as well as the second boxed set, all feature an image of a crop circle that appeared in East Field in Alton Barnes, Wiltshire.\n\nOn the night of 11–12 July 1992, a crop-circle making competition with a prize of £3,000 (funded in part by the Arthur Koestler Foundation) was held in Berkshire. The winning entry was produced by three Westland Helicopters engineers, using rope, PVC pipe, a plank, string, a telescopic device and two stepladders. According to Rupert Sheldrake, the competition was organised by him and John Michell and \"co-sponsored by The Guardian and The Cerealogist\". The prize money came from PM, a German magazine. Sheldrake wrote that \"The experiment was conclusive. Humans could indeed make all the features of state-of-the-art crop formations at that time. Eleven of the twelve teams made more or less impressive formations that followed the set design.\"In 2002, Discovery Channel commissioned five aeronautics and astronautics graduate students from MIT to create crop circles of their own, aiming to duplicate some of the features claimed to distinguish \"real\" crop circles from the known fakes such as those created by Bower and Chorley. The creation of the circle was recorded and used in the Discovery Channel documentary Crop Circles: Mysteries in the Fields.In 2009, The Guardian reported that crop circle activity had been waning around Wiltshire, in part because makers preferred creating promotional crop circles for companies that paid well for their efforts.A video sequence used in connection with the opening of the 2012 Summer Olympics in London showed two crop circles in the shape of the Olympic rings.  Another Olympic crop circle was visible to passengers landing at nearby Heathrow Airport before and during the Games.A 7-acre (2.8-hectare) crop circle depicting the emblem of the Star Wars Rebel Alliance was created in California in December 2017 by an 11-year-old boy as a spaceport for X-wing fighters.\n\n\n== Legal implications ==\nIn 1992, Hungarian youths Gábor Takács and Róbert Dallos, both then 17, were the first people to face legal action after creating a crop circle. Takács and Dallos, of the St. Stephen Agricultural Technicum, a high school in Hungary specializing in agriculture, created a 36-metre (118 ft) diameter crop circle in a wheat field near Székesfehérvár, 43 miles (69 km) southwest of Budapest, on June 8, 1992. On September 3, the pair appeared on Hungarian TV and exposed the circle as a hoax, showing photos of the field before and after the circle was made. As a result, Aranykalász Co., the owners of the land, sued the teens for 630,000 Ft (~$3,000 USD) in damages. The presiding judge ruled that the students were only responsible for the damage caused in the circle itself, amounting to about 6,000 Ft (~$30 USD), and that 99% of the damage to the crops was caused by the thousands of visitors who flocked to Székesfehérvár following the media\'s promotion of the circle. The fine was eventually paid by the TV show, as were the students\' legal fees.In 2000, Matthew Williams became the first man in the UK to be arrested for causing criminal damage after making a crop circle near Devizes. In November 2000, he was fined £100 and £40 in costs. As of  2008, no one else has been successfully prosecuted in the UK for criminal damage caused by creating crop circles.\n\n\n== Creation ==\n\nThe scientific consensus on crop circles is that they are constructed by human beings as hoaxes, advertising, or art. The most widely known method for a person or group to construct a crop formation is to tie one end of a rope to an anchor point and the other end to a board which is used to crush the plants. Sceptics of the paranormal point out that all characteristics of crop circles are fully compatible with their being made by hoaxers.Bower and Chorley confessed in 1991 to making the first crop circles in southern England. When some people refused to believe them, they deliberately added straight lines and squares to show that they could not have natural causes. In a copycat effect, increasingly complex circles started appearing in many countries around the world, including fractal figures. Physicists have suggested that the most complex formations might be made with the help of GPS and lasers. In 2009, a circle formation was made over the course of three consecutive nights and was apparently left unfinished, with some half-made circles.The main criticism of alleged non-human creation of crop circles is that while evidence of these origins, besides eyewitness testimonies, is essentially absent, some are definitely known to be the work of human pranksters, and others can be adequately explained as such. There have been cases in which researchers declared crop circles to be \"the real thing\", only to be confronted with the people who created the circle and documented the fraud, like Bower and Chorley and tabloid Today hoaxing Pat Delgado, the Wessex Sceptics and Channel 4\'s Equinox hoaxing Terence Meaden, or a friend of a Canadian farmer hoaxing a field researcher of the Canadian Crop Circle Research Network. In his 1997 book The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, Carl Sagan concludes that crop circles were created by Bower and Chorley and their copycats, and speculates that UFOlogists willingly ignore the evidence for hoaxing so they can keep believing in an extraterrestrial origin of the circles. Many others have demonstrated how complex crop circles can be created. Scientific American published an article by Matt Ridley, who started making crop circles in northern England in 1991. He wrote about how easy it is to develop techniques using simple tools that can easily fool later observers. He reported on \"expert\" sources such as The Wall Street Journal, who had been easily fooled and mused about why people want to believe supernatural explanations for phenomena that are not yet explained. Methods of creating a crop circle are now well documented on the Internet.Some crop formations are paid for by companies who use them as advertising. Many crop circles show human symbols, like the heart and arrow symbol of love, stereotyped alien faces,Hoaxers have been caught in the process of making new circles, such as in 2004 in the Netherlands for example (see more cases in \"legal implications\" section above).\nAdvocates of non-human causes discount on-site evidence of human involvement as attempts to discredit the phenomena. Some even argue a conspiracy theory, with governments planting evidence of hoaxing to muddle the origins of the circles. When Ridley wrote negative articles in newspapers, he was accused of spreading \"government disinformation\" and of working for the UK military intelligence service MI5. Ridley responded by noting that many cereologists make good livings from selling books and providing high-priced personal tours through crop fields, and he claimed that they have vested interests in rejecting what is by far the most likely explanation for the circles.\n\n\n== Alternative explanations ==\n\n\n=== Weather ===\nIt has been suggested that crop circles may be the result of extraordinary meteorological phenomena ranging from freak tornadoes to ball lightning, but there is no evidence of any crop circle being created by any of these causes.In 1880, an amateur scientist, John Rand Capron, wrote a letter to the editor of journal Nature about some circles in crops and blamed them on a recent storm, saying their shape was \"suggestive of some cyclonic wind action\".In 1980, Terence Meaden, a meteorologist and physicist, proposed that the circles were caused by whirlwinds whose course was affected by southern England hills. As circles became more complex, Terence had to create increasingly complex theories, blaming an electromagneto-hydrodynamic \"plasma vortex\". The meteorological theory became popular, and it was even referenced in 1991 by physicist Stephen Hawking who said that, \"Corn circles are either hoaxes or formed by vortex movement of air\". The weather theory suffered a serious blow in 1991, but Hawking\'s point about hoaxes was supported when Bower and Chorley stated that they had been responsible for making all those circles. By the end of 1991 Meaden conceded that those circles that had complex designs were made by hoaxers.\n\n\n=== Paranormal ===\n\nSince becoming the focus of widespread media attention in the 1980s, crop circles have become the subject of speculation by various paranormal, ufological, and anomalistic investigators ranging from proposals that they were created by bizarre meteorological phenomena to messages from extraterrestrial beings. There has also been speculation that crop circles have a relation to ley lines. Many  New Age groups incorporate crop circles into their belief systems.\nSome paranormal advocates think that crop circles are caused by ball lighting and that the patterns are so complex that they have to be controlled by some entity. Some proposed entities are: Gaia asking to stop global warming and human pollution, God, supernatural beings (for example Indian devas), the collective minds of humanity through a proposed \"quantum field\", or extraterrestrial beings.Responding to local beliefs that \"extraterrestrial beings\" in UFOs were responsible for crop circles appearing, the Indonesian National Institute of Aeronautics and Space (LAPAN) described crop circles as \"man-made\". Thomas Djamaluddin, research professor of astronomy and astrophysics at LAPAN stated, \"We have come to agree that this \'thing\' cannot be scientifically proven.\" Among others, paranormal enthusiasts, ufologists, and anomalistic investigators have offered hypothetical explanations that have been criticized as pseudoscientific by sceptical groups and scientists, including the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry. No credible evidence of extraterrestrial origin has been presented.\n\n\n=== Animal activity ===\nIn 2009, the attorney general for the island state of Tasmania stated that Australian wallabies had been found creating crop circles in fields of opium poppies, which are grown legally for medicinal use, after consuming some of the opiate-laden poppies and running in circles.\n\n\n=== Changes to crops ===\nA small number of scientists (physicist Eltjo Haselhoff, the late biophysicist William Levengood) have found differences between the crops inside the circles and outside them, citing this as evidence they were not man-made.Levengood published papers in journal Physiologia Plantarum in 1994 and 1999. In his 1994 paper he found that certain deformities in the grain inside the circles were correlated to the position of the grain inside the circle. In 1996 sceptic Joe Nickell objected that correlation is not causation, raised several objections to Levengood\'s methods and assumptions, and said \"Until his work is independently replicated by qualified scientists doing \'double-blind\' studies and otherwise following stringent scientific protocols, there seems no need to take seriously the many dubious claims that Levengood makes, including his similar ones involving plants at alleged \'cattle mutilation\' sites.\" (in reference to cattle mutilation).A study by Eltjo Haselhoff reported that the pulvini of wheat in 95% of the crop circles investigated were elongated in a pattern falling off with distance from the centre and that seeds from the bent-over plants grew much more slowly under controlled conditions. Furthermore, traces of crop circle patterns are sometimes found in the crop the following year, \"suggesting long-term damage to the crop field consistent with Levengood\'s observations of stunted seed growth.\"\n\n\n=== Magnetism ===\nIn 2000, Colin Andrews, who had researched crop circles for 17 years, stated that while he believed 80% were man-made, he thought the remaining circles, with less elaborate designs, could be explained by a three-degree shift in the Earth\'s magnetic field, that creates a current that \"electrocutes\" the crops, causing them to flatten and form the circle.\n\n\n== Folklore ==\nResearchers of crop circles have linked modern crop circles to old folkloric tales to support the claim that they are not artificially produced. Circle crops are culture-dependent: they appear mostly in developed and secularized Western countries where people are receptive to New Age beliefs, including Japan, but they don\'t appear at all in other zones, such as Muslim countries.Fungi can cause circular areas of crop to die, probably the origin of tales of \"fairie rings\". Tales also mention balls of light many times but never in relation to crop circles.\n\nA 17th-century English woodcut called the Mowing-Devil depicts the devil with a scythe mowing (cutting) a circular design in a field of oats. The pamphlet containing the image states that the farmer, disgusted at the wage his mower was demanding for his work, insisted that he would rather have \"the devil himself\" perform the task.  Crop circle researcher Jim Schnabel does not consider this to be a historical precedent for crop circles because the stalks were cut down, not bent. The circular form indicated to the farmer that it had been caused by the devil.In the 1948 German story Die zwölf Schwäne (The Twelve Swans), a farmer every morning found a circular ring of flattened grain on his field. After several attempts, his son saw twelve princesses disguised as swans, who took off their disguises and danced in the field. Crop rings produced by fungi may have inspired such tales since folklore holds these rings are created by dancing wolves or fairies.\n\n\n== See also ==\nGeoglyph\nGerald Hawkins\nLand art\nList of hoaxes\nList of topics characterized as pseudoscience\nNazca Lines\nRice paddy art\nViking ring fortress\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nPat Delgado & Colin Andrews (1989).

(135, 'Moon landing conspiracy theories', 'Moon landing conspiracy theories claim that some or all elements of the Apollo program and the associated Moon landings were hoaxes staged by NASA, possibly with the aid of other organizations. The most notable claim is that the six manned landings (1969–72) were faked and that 12 Apollo astronauts did not actually walk on the Moon. Various groups and individuals have made claims since the mid-1970s that NASA and others knowingly misled the public into believing the landings happened, by manufacturing, tampering with, or destroying evidence including photos, telemetry tapes, radio and TV transmissions, Moon rock samples, and even killing some key witnesses.\nMuch third-party evidence for the landings exists, and detailed rebuttals to the hoax claims have been made. Since the late 2000s, high-definition photos taken by the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) of the Apollo landing sites have captured the lander modules and the tracks left by the astronauts. In 2012, images were released showing five of the six Apollo missions\' American flags erected on the Moon still standing; the exception is that of Apollo 11, which has lain on the lunar surface since being accidentally blown over by the takeoff rocket\'s exhaust.Conspiracists have managed to sustain public interest in their theories for more than 40 years, despite the rebuttals and third-party evidence. Opinion polls taken in various locations have shown that between 6% and 20% of Americans, 25% of Britons, and 28% of Russians surveyed believe that the manned landings were faked. Even as late as 2001, the Fox television network documentary Conspiracy Theory: Did We Land on the Moon? claimed NASA faked the first landing in 1969 to win the Space Race.\n\n\n== Origins ==\nAn early and influential book about the subject of a moon-landing conspiracy, We Never Went to the Moon: America\'s Thirty Billion Dollar Swindle, was self-published in 1976 by Bill Kaysing, a former US Navy officer with a Bachelor of Arts in English. Despite having no knowledge of rockets or technical writing, Kaysing was hired as a senior technical writer in 1956 by Rocketdyne, the company that built the F-1 engines used on the Saturn V rocket. He served as head of the technical publications unit at the company\'s Propulsion Field Laboratory until 1963. Kaysing\'s book made many allegations, and effectively began discussion of the Moon landings being faked. The book claims that the chance of a successful manned landing on the Moon was calculated to be 0.0017%, and that despite close monitoring by the USSR, it would have been easier for NASA to fake the Moon landings than to really go there.In 1980, the Flat Earth Society accused NASA of faking the landings, arguing that they were staged by Hollywood with Walt Disney sponsorship, based on a script by Arthur C. Clarke and directed by Stanley Kubrick. Folklorist Linda Dégh suggests that writer-director Peter Hyams\' 1978 film Capricorn One, which shows a hoaxed journey to Mars in a spacecraft that looks identical to the Apollo craft, might have given a boost to the hoax theory\'s popularity in the post-Vietnam War era. She notes that this happened during the post-Watergate era, when American citizens were inclined to distrust official accounts. Dégh writes: \"The mass media catapult these half-truths into a kind of twilight zone where people can make their guesses sound as truths. Mass media have a terrible impact on people who lack guidance.\" In A Man on the Moon, first published in 1994, Andrew Chaikin mentions that at the time of Apollo 8\'s lunar-orbit mission in December 1968, similar conspiracy ideas were already in circulation.\n\n\n== Conspiracists and their contentions ==\nAfter Kaysing, Moon-landing conspiracists include (in alphabetical order):\n\nMarcus Allen – British publisher of Nexus, who said photographs of the lander would not prove that the United States put men on the Moon, and \"Getting to the Moon really isn\'t much of a problem – the Russians did that in 1959. The big problem is getting people there.\" He suggests that NASA sent robot missions because radiation levels in outer space would be deadly. A variant of this idea has it that NASA and its contractors did not recover quickly enough from the Apollo 1 fire, and so all the early Apollo missions were faked, with Apollos 14 or 15 being the first real mission.\nWilliam L. Brian – a nuclear engineer who self-published a book in 1982, Moongate: Suppressed Findings of the U.S. Space Program, in which he disputes the Moon\'s surface gravity.\nJames M. Collier (d. 1998) – American journalist and writer, producer of the video Was It Only a Paper Moon? (1997).\nMilton William Cooper (1943–2001) – was an American conspiracy theorist and author. He believed that all of the Apollo missions to the Moon were actually carefully rehearsed productions that were then filmed in large sound stages.\nJames H. Fetzer – retired American philosophy professor and conspiracy theorist. On May 2, 2013, Dr. Fetzer was interviewed by Dr. Sterling Harwood. Fetzer defended his conspiracist views that all six lunar landings were hoaxes.\nDavid Groves – works for Quantech Image Processing. He examined the photo of Aldrin emerging from the lander and said he can pinpoint when a spotlight was used. Using the focal length of the camera\'s lens and an actual boot, he allegedly calculated, using ray-tracing, that the spotlight is between 24 and 36 centimetres (9.4 and 14.2 in) to the right of the camera. This matches with the sunlit part of Armstrong\'s spacesuit.\nClyde Lewis – radio talk show host who says the 1969 Moon landing was fake.\nPhilippe Lheureux – French author of Lumières sur la Lune. An English language edition was published in 2003, Moon Landings: Did NASA Lie? He said that astronauts did land on the Moon, but to stop other states from benefiting from scientific information in the real photos, NASA published fake images.\nYury Ignatyevich Mukhin – Russian opposition politician, publicist and author of the book Antiapollon: Moonlight scam US in which he denies all Moon landing evidence and accuses the United States government of plundering the money paid by the American taxpayers for the Moon program. He also claims the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and some Soviet scientists helped NASA fake the landings.\nDavid S. Percy – TV producer. He is co-author, along with Mary Bennett, of Dark Moon: Apollo and the Whistle-Blowers and co-producer of What Happened On the Moon? He is the main proponent of the \'whistle-blower\' accusation, arguing that mistakes in the NASA photos are so obvious that they are evidence that insiders are trying to \'blow the whistle\' on the hoax by knowingly adding mistakes that they know will be seen. Most of his allegations of photographic anomalies have been refuted by Doug Millard of the Science Museum in London.\nStanislav Pokrovsky – Russian general director of a scientific-manufacturing enterprise Project-D-MSK who calculated that the real speed of the Saturn V rocket at S-IC staging time was only half of what was claimed. His analysis appears to assume that the solid rocket plumes from the fuselage and retrorockets on the two stages came to an instant halt in the surrounding air so they can be used to estimate the velocity of the rocket. He ignored high-altitude winds and the altitude at staging, 67 km, where air is about 1/10,000 as dense as at sea level, and claimed that only a loop around the Moon was possible, not a manned landing on the Moon with return to Earth. He also allegedly found the reason for this – problems with the Inconel superalloy used in the F-1 engine.\nAlexander Ivanovich Popov – Russian author of the book The Americans on the Moon: the great breakthrough or cosmic scam?? in which he aims to prove that Saturn V was in fact a camouflaged Saturn IB and denies all Moon landing evidence.\nAron Ranen – a filmmaker, directed and produced the documentary Did We Go?\nRalph René (1933–2008) – was an inventor and \'self-taught\' engineering buff. Author of the self-published book NASA Mooned America!\nBart Sibrel – a filmmaker, produced and directed four films for his company, AFTH, LLC, including a 2001 film, A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Moon, examining the evidence of a hoax. The arguments that Sibrel puts forward in this film have been debunked by many sources, including Svector Studios\' five-part video series Lunar Legacy, which disproves the documentary\'s main argument that the Apollo crew faked their distance from the Earth while in low Earth orbit. Sibrel has said that the effect on the shot covered in his film was made through the use of a transparency of the Earth. Some parts of the original footage, according to Sibrel, were not able to be included on the official releases for the media. On such allegedly censored parts, the correlation between Earth and Moon phases can be clearly confirmed, refuting Sibrel\'s claim that these shots were faked. On September 9, 2002, Sibrel was punched in the face by Buzz Aldrin after Sibrel confronted Aldrin with his theories and accused the former astronaut of being \"a coward, and a liar, and a thief.\" The Los Angeles County district attorney\'s office refused to file charges against Aldrin, saying that he had been provoked by Sibrel.\nTakahiko Soejima – Japanese political scientist, author of 人類の月面着陸は無かったろう論.\nJay Weidner – author and interviewee about the Moon conspiracy theory in the documentary film Room 237 (2012). In this film he repeatedly states that he does not necessarily doubt that America landed men on the Moon even though he thinks there was a conspiracy with Stanley Kubrick to fake the lunar landing footage.\nJack D. White (1927–2012) – was an American photo historian known for his attempt to prove forgery in photos and the Zapruder film related to the assassination of John F. Kennedy.\nGerhard Wisnewski – German journalist and filmmaker, author of One Small Step?: The Great Moon Hoax and the Race to Dominate Earth from Space.\n\n\n== Claimed motives of the United States and NASA ==\nThose who believe the Moon landings were faked give several theories about the motives of NASA and the United States government. The three main theories are below.\n\n\n=== The Space Race ===\nMotivation for the United States to engage the Soviet Union in a Space Race can be traced to the then on-going Cold War. Landing on the Moon was viewed as a national and technological accomplishment that would generate world-wide acclaim. But going to the Moon would be risky and expensive, as exemplified by President John F. Kennedy famously stating in a 1962 speech that the United States chose to go because it was hard.Hoax theory-debunker Philip Plait says in his book Bad Astronomy, that the Soviets – with their own competing Moon program, an extensive intelligence network and a formidable scientific community able to analyze NASA data – would have cried foul if the United States tried to fake a Moon landing, especially since their own program had failed. Proving a hoax would have been a huge propaganda win for the Soviets. Conspiracist Bart Sibrel responded, \"the Soviets did not have the capability to track deep space craft until late in 1972, immediately after which, the last three Apollo missions were abruptly canceled.\"In fact, the Soviets had been sending unmanned spacecraft to the Moon since 1959, and \"during 1962, deep space tracking facilities were introduced at IP-15 in Ussuriisk and IP-16 in Evpatoria (Crimean Peninsula), while Saturn communication stations were added to IP-3, 4 and 14,\" the latter having a 100 million km range. The Soviet Union tracked the Apollo missions at the Space Transmissions Corps, which was \"fully equipped with the latest intelligence-gathering and surveillance equipment.\" Vasily Mishin, in an interview for the article \"The Moon Programme That Faltered,\" describes how the Soviet Moon program dwindled after the Apollo landings.Also, there was nothing \"abrupt\" about the Apollo cancelations, which were announced in January and September 1970 for cost-cutting reasons. (See Vietnam War below.)\n\n\n=== NASA funding and prestige ===\nConspiracy theorists claim that NASA faked the landings to avoid humiliation and to ensure that it continued to get funding. NASA raised \"about US$30 billion\" to go to the Moon, and Kaysing claimed in his book that this could have been used to \"pay off\" many people. Since most conspiracists believe that sending men to the Moon was impossible at the time, they argue that landings had to be faked to fulfill Kennedy\'s 1961 goal, \"before this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth.\" In fact, NASA accounted for the cost of Apollo to the US Congress in 1973, totaling US$25.4 billion.Mary Bennett and David Percy have claimed in Dark Moon: Apollo and the Whistle-Blowers, that, with all the known and unknown hazards, NASA would not risk broadcasting an astronaut getting sick or dying on live television. The counter-argument generally given is that NASA in fact did incur a great deal of public humiliation and potential political opposition to the program by losing an entire crew in the Apollo 1 fire during a ground test, leading to its upper management team being questioned by Senate and House of Representatives space oversight committees. There was in fact no video broadcast during either the landing or takeoff because of technological limitations.\n\n\n=== Vietnam War ===\nThe American Patriot Friends Network claimed in 2009 that the landings helped the United States government distract public attention from the unpopular Vietnam War, and so manned landings suddenly ended about the same time that the United States ended its involvement in the war. In fact, the ending of the landings was not \"sudden\" (see The Space Race above). The war was one of several federal budget items with which NASA had to compete; NASA\'s budget peaked in 1966, and fell by 42.3% by 1972. This was the reason the final flights were cut, along with plans for even more ambitious follow-on programs such as a permanent space station and manned flight to Mars.\n\n\n== Hoax claims and rebuttals ==\nMany Moon-landing conspiracy theories have been put forward, claiming either that the landings did not happen and that NASA employees have lied, or that the landings did happen but not in the way that has been told. Conspiracists have focused on perceived gaps or inconsistencies in the historical record of the missions. The foremost idea is that the whole manned landing program was a hoax from start to end. Some claim that the technology to send men to the Moon was lacking or that the Van Allen radiation belts, solar flares, solar wind, coronal mass ejections and cosmic rays made such a trip impossible.Vince Calder and Andrew Johnson, scientists from Argonne National Laboratory, have given detailed answers to  conspiracists\' claims on the laboratory\'s website. They show that NASA\'s portrayal of the Moon landing is fundamentally accurate, allowing for such common mistakes as mislabeled photos and imperfect personal recollections. Using the scientific process, any hypothesis that is contradicted by the observable facts may be rejected. The \'real landing\' hypothesis is a single story since it comes from a single source, but there is no unity in the hoax hypothesis because hoax accounts vary between conspiracists.\n\n\n=== Number of conspirators involved ===\nAccording to James Longuski (Professor of Aeronautics and Astronautics Engineering at Purdue University), the conspiracy theories are impossible because of their size and complexity. The conspiracy would have to involve more than 400,000 people who worked on the Apollo project for nearly ten years, the 12 men who walked on the Moon, the six others who flew with them as Command Module pilots, and another six astronauts who orbited the Moon. Hundreds of thousands of people – including astronauts, scientists, engineers, technicians, and skilled laborers – would have had to keep the secret. Longuski argues that it would have been much easier to really land on the Moon than to generate such a huge conspiracy to fake the landings. To date, nobody from the United States government or NASA linked to the Apollo program has said the Moon landings were hoaxes. Penn Jillette made note of this in the \"Conspiracy Theories\" episode of his television show Penn & Teller: Bullshit! in 2005. With the number of people involved, and noting the Watergate scandal, Jillette noted that someone would have outed the hoax by now.\n\n\n=== Photographic and film oddities ===\n\nMoon-landing conspiracists focus heavily on NASA photos. They point to oddities in photos and films taken on the Moon. Photography experts (including those unrelated to NASA) have replied that the oddities are consistent with what should be expected from a real Moon landing, and are not consistent with tweaked or studio imagery. Some main arguments and counter-arguments are listed below.\n1. In some photos, the crosshairs appear to be behind objects. The cameras were fitted with a Réseau plate (a clear glass plate with a reticle etched on), making it impossible for any photographed object to appear \"in front\" of the grid. Conspiracists often use this evidence to suggest that objects were \"pasted\" over the photographs, and hence obscure the reticle.\n\nThis effect only appears in copied and scanned photos, not any originals. It is caused by overexposure: the bright white areas of the emulsion \"bleed\" over the thin black crosshairs. The crosshairs are only about 0.004 inches thick (0.1 mm) and emulsion would only have to bleed about half that much to fully obscure it. Furthermore, there are many photos where the middle of the crosshair is \"washed-out\" but the rest is intact. In some photos of the American flag, parts of one crosshair appear on the red stripes, but parts of the same crosshair are faded or invisible on the white stripes. There would have been no reason to \"paste\" white stripes onto the flag.\n\n2. Crosshairs are sometimes rotated or in the wrong place.\n\nThis is a result of popular photos being cropped and/or rotated for aesthetic impact.3. The quality of the photographs is implausibly high.\n\nThere are many poor-quality photos taken by the Apollo astronauts. NASA chose to publish only the best examples.\nThe Apollo astronauts used high-resolution Hasselblad 500 EL cameras with Carl Zeiss optics and a 70 mm medium format film magazine.4. There are no stars in any of the photos; the Apollo 11 astronauts also stated in post-mission press conferences that they did not remember seeing any stars during EVA. Conspiracists contend that NASA chose not to put the stars into the photos because astronomers would have been able to use them to determine whether the photos were taken from the Earth or the Moon, by means of identifying them and comparing their celestial position and parallax to what would be expected for either observation site.\n\nThe astronauts were talking about naked-eye sightings of stars during the lunar daytime. They regularly sighted stars through the spacecraft navigation optics while aligning their inertial reference platforms, the Apollo PGNCS.Stars are rarely seen in Space Shuttle, Mir, Earth observation photos, or even photos taken at sporting events held at night. The light from the Sun in outer space in the Earth-Moon system is at least as bright as the sunlight that reaches the Earth\'s surface on a clear day at noon, so cameras used for imaging subjects illuminated by sunlight are set for a daylight exposure. The dim light of the stars simply does not provide enough exposure to record visible images. All manned landings happened during the lunar daytime. Thus, the stars were outshone by the sun and by sunlight reflected off the Moon\'s surface. The astronauts\' eyes were adapted to the sunlit landscape around them so that they could not see the relatively faint stars. The astronauts could see stars with the naked eye only when they were in the shadow of the Moon.Camera settings can turn a well-lit background to black when the foreground object is brightly lit, forcing the camera to increase shutter speed so that the foreground light does not wash out the image. A demonstration of this effect is here. The effect is similar to not being able to see stars from a brightly lit car park at night – the stars only become visible when the lights are turned off.A special far ultraviolet camera, the Far Ultraviolet Camera/Spectrograph, was taken to the lunar surface on Apollo 16 and operated in the shadow of the Apollo Lunar Module (LM). It took photos of Earth and of many stars, some of which are dim in visible light but bright in the ultraviolet. These observations were later matched with observations taken by orbiting ultraviolet telescopes. Furthermore, the positions of those stars with respect to Earth are correct for the time and location of the Apollo 16 photos.Photos of the solar corona that included the planet Mercury and some background stars were taken from lunar orbit by Apollo 15 Command Module Pilot Al Worden.Photos of the planet Venus (which is much brighter than any of the stars) were taken from the Moon\'s surface by astronaut Alan Shepard during the Apollo 14 mission.\n\n5. The angle and color of shadows are inconsistent. This suggests that artificial lights were used.\n\nShadows on the Moon are complicated by reflected light, uneven ground, wide-angle lens distortion, and lunar dust. There are several light sources: the Sun, sunlight reflected from the Earth, sunlight reflected from the Moon\'s surface, and sunlight reflected from the astronauts and the Lunar Module. Light from these sources is scattered by lunar dust in many directions, including into shadows. Shadows falling into craters and hills may appear longer, shorter and distorted. Furthermore, shadows display the properties of vanishing point perspective, leading them to converge to a point on the horizon.\nThis theory was further debunked on the MythBusters episode \"NASA Moon Landing\".6. There are identical backgrounds in photos which, according to their captions, were taken miles apart. This suggests that a painted background was used.\n\nBackgrounds were not identical, just similar. What appear as nearby hills in some photos are actually mountains many miles away. On Earth, objects that are further away will appear fainter and less detailed. On the Moon, there is no atmosphere or haze to obscure faraway objects, thus they appear clearer and nearer. Furthermore, there are very few objects (such as trees) to help judge distance. One such case is debunked in \"Who Mourns For Apollo?\" by Mike Bara.7. The number of photos taken is implausibly high. Up to one photo per 50 seconds.\nSimplified gear with fixed settings allowed two photos a second. Many were taken immediately after each other as stereo pairs or panorama sequences. The calculation (one per 50 seconds) was based on a lone astronaut on the surface, and does not take into account that there were two astronauts sharing the workload and simultaneously taking photographs during an Extra-vehicular activity (EVA).8. The photos contain artifacts like the two seemingly matching \'C\'s on a rock and on the ground. These may be labeled studio props.\n\nThe \"C\"-shaped objects are most likely printing imperfections and do not appear in the original film from the camera. It has been suggested that the \"C\" is a coiled hair.\n\n9. A resident of Perth, Western Australia, a woman named Una Ronald (a pseudonym created by the authors of the source), said that for two or three seconds she saw a Coca-Cola bottle roll across the lower right quadrant of her television screen that was displaying the live broadcast of the Apollo 11 EVA. She also said that several letters appeared in The West Australian discussing the Coca-Cola bottle incident within ten days of the lunar landing.\nNo such newspaper reports or recordings have been found. Ronald\'s claims have only been relayed by one source. There are also flaws in the story, e.g. the statement that she had to stay up late to watch the Moon landing live is easily discounted by many witnesses in Australia who watched the landing in the middle of their daytime.10. The book Moon Shot contains an obviously fake composite photo of Alan Shepard hitting a golf ball on the Moon with another astronaut.\n\n It was used instead of the only existing real images, from the TV monitor, which the editors seemingly felt were too grainy for their book. The book publishers did not work for NASA.11. There appear to be \"hot spots\" in some photos that look like a large spotlight was used in place of the sun.\n\n Pits on the Moon\'s surface focus and reflect light like the tiny glass spheres used in the coating of street signs, or dewdrops on wet grass. This creates a glow around the photographer\'s own shadow when it appears in a photograph (see Heiligenschein).\nIf the astronaut is standing in sunlight while photographing into shade, light reflected off his white spacesuit yields a similar effect to a spotlight.\nSome widely published Apollo photos were high-contrast copies. Scans of the original transparencies are generally much more evenly lit. An example is shown below:\n\n12. Who filmed Neil Armstrong stepping onto the Moon?\n\nThe Lunar Module did. While still on the Module\'s ladder steps, Armstrong deployed the Modularized Equipment Stowage Assembly from the side of the Lunar Module, unpacking, amongst other things, the TV camera. The TV camera was then powered on and a signal transmitted to the command module, which beamed the live signal back to Earth. This meant that upwards of 600 million people on Earth could watch the live feed with only a very slight delay. Similar technology was also used on subsequent Apollo missions.\n\n\n=== Environment ===\n1. The astronauts could not have survived the trip because of exposure to radiation from the Van Allen radiation belt and galactic ambient radiation (see radiation poisoning and health threat from cosmic rays). Some conspiracists have suggested that Starfish Prime (a high-altitude nuclear test in 1962) was a failed attempt to disrupt the Van Allen belts.\n\nThere are two main Van Allen belts – the inner belt and the outer belt – and a transient third belt. The inner belt is the more dangerous one, containing energetic protons. The outer one has less-dangerous low-energy electrons (Beta particles). The Apollo spacecraft passed through the inner belt in a matter of minutes and the outer belt in about ​1 1⁄2 hours. The astronauts were shielded from the ionizing radiation by the aluminum hulls of the spacecraft. Furthermore, the orbital transfer trajectory from Earth to the Moon through the belts was chosen to lessen radiation exposure. Even Dr. James Van Allen, the discoverer of the Van Allen radiation belts, rebutted the claims that radiation levels were too harmful for the Apollo missions. Plait cited an average dose of less than 1 rem (10 mSv), which is equivalent to the ambient radiation received by living at sea level for three years. The total radiation received on the trip was about the same as allowed for workers in the nuclear energy field for a year and not much more than what Space Shuttle astronauts received.2. Film in the cameras would have been fogged by this radiation.\n\nThe film was kept in metal containers that stopped radiation from fogging the film\'s emulsion. Furthermore, film carried by unmanned lunar probes such as the Lunar Orbiter and Luna 3 (which used on-board film development processes) was not fogged.3. The Moon\'s surface during the daytime is so hot that camera film would have melted.\n\nThere is no atmosphere to efficiently bind lunar surface heat to devices (such as cameras) that are not in direct contact with it. In a vacuum, only radiation remains as a heat transfer mechanism. The physics of radiative heat transfer are thoroughly understood, and the proper use of passive optical coatings and paints was enough to control the temperature of the film within the cameras; Lunar Module temperatures were controlled with similar coatings that gave them a gold color. Also, while the Moon\'s surface does get very hot at lunar noon, every Apollo landing was made shortly after lunar sunrise at the landing site; the Moon\'s day is about ​29 1⁄2 Earth days long, meaning that one Moon day (dawn to dusk) lasts nearly fifteen Earth days. During the longer stays, the astronauts did notice increased cooling loads on their spacesuits as the sun and surface temperature continued to rise, but the effect was easily countered by the passive and active cooling systems. The film was not in direct sunlight, so it was not overheated.4. The Apollo 16 crew could not have survived a big solar flare firing out when they were on their way to the Moon.\n\nNo large solar flare occurred during the flight of Apollo 16. There were large solar flares in August 1972, after Apollo 16 returned to Earth and before the flight of Apollo 17.5. The flag placed on the surface by the astronauts fluttered despite there being no wind on the Moon. This suggests that it was filmed on Earth and a breeze caused the flag to flutter. Sibrel said that it may have been caused by indoor fans used to cool the astronauts since their spacesuit cooling systems would have been too heavy on Earth.\n\nThe flag was fastened to a Г-shaped rod (see Lunar Flag Assembly) so that it did not hang down. The flag only seemed to flutter when the astronauts were moving it into position. Without air drag, these movements caused the free corner of the flag to swing like a pendulum for some time. The flag was rippled because it had been folded during storage – the ripples could be mistaken for movement in a still photo. Videos show that when the astronauts let go of the flagpole it vibrates briefly but then remains still.\nThis theory was further debunked on the MythBusters episode \"NASA Moon Landing\".\n\n6. Footprints in the Moondust are unexpectedly well preserved, despite the lack of moisture.\n\nMoondust has not been weathered like Earth sand and has sharp edges. This allows the dust particles to stick together and hold their shape in the vacuum. The astronauts likened it to \"talcum powder or wet sand\".\nThis theory was further debunked on the MythBusters episode \"NASA Moon Landing\".7. The alleged Moon landings used either a sound stage or were filmed outside in a remote desert with the astronauts either using harnesses or slow-motion photography to make it look like they were on the Moon.\n\nWhile the HBO miniseries \"From the Earth to the Moon\", and a scene from the movie \"Apollo 13\" used the sound-stage and harness setup, it is clearly seen from those films that when dust rose it did not quickly settle; some dust briefly formed clouds. In the film footage from the Apollo missions, dust kicked up by the astronauts\' boots and the wheels of the Lunar Roving Vehicles rose quite high due to the lower lunar gravity, and settled quickly to the ground in an uninterrupted parabolic arc since there was no air to suspend the dust. Even if there had been a sound stage for hoax Moon landings that had the air pumped out, the dust would have reached nowhere near the height and trajectory as in the Apollo film footage because of Earth\'s greater gravity.During the Apollo 15 mission, David Scott did an experiment by dropping a hammer and a falcon feather at the same time. Both fell at the same rate and hit the ground at the same time. This proved that he was in a vacuum.If the landings were filmed outside in a desert, heat waves would be present on the surface in mission videos, but no such heat waves exist in the footage. If the landings were filmed in a sound stage, several anomalies would occur, including a lack of parallax, and an increase or decrease in the size of the backdrop if the camera moved (footage was filmed while the rover was in motion, and yet no evidence of any change in the size of the background is present).This theory was further debunked on the MythBusters episode \"NASA Moon Landing\".\n\n\n=== Mechanical issues ===\n\n1. The Lunar Modules made no blast craters or any sign of dust scatter.\nNo crater should be expected. The 10,000-pound thrust Descent Propulsion System was throttled very far down during the final landing. The Lunar Module was no longer quickly decelerating, so the descent engine only had to support the lander\'s own weight, which was lessened by the Moon\'s gravity and by the near exhaustion of the descent propellants. At landing, the engine thrust divided by the nozzle exit area is only about 10 kilopascals (1.5 PSI). Beyond the engine nozzle, the plume spreads, and the pressure drops very quickly. Rocket exhaust gasses expand much more quickly after leaving the engine nozzle in a vacuum than in an atmosphere. The effect of an atmosphere on rocket plumes can be easily seen in launches from Earth; as the rocket rises through the thinning atmosphere, the exhaust plumes broaden very noticeably. To lessen this, rocket engines made for vacuums have longer bells than those made for use on Earth, but they still cannot stop this spreading. The lander\'s exhaust gasses, therefore, expanded quickly well beyond the landing site. The descent engines did scatter a lot of very fine surface dust as seen in 16mm movies of each landing, and many mission commanders spoke of its effect on visibility. The landers were generally moving horizontally as well as vertically, and photos do show scouring of the surface along the final descent path. Finally, the lunar regolith is very compact below its surface dust layer, making it impossible for the descent engine to blast out a \"crater\". A blast crater was measured under the Apollo 11 lander using shadow lengths of the descent engine bell and estimates of the amount that the landing gear had compressed and how deep the lander footpads had pressed into the lunar surface and it was found that the engine had eroded between 4 and 6 inches of regolith out from underneath the engine bell during the final descent and landing.2. The second stage of the launch rocket and/or the Lunar Module ascent stage made no visible flame.\n\nThe Lunar Modules used Aerozine 50 (fuel) and dinitrogen tetroxide (oxidizer) propellants, chosen for simplicity and reliability; they ignite hypergolically – upon contact – without the need for a spark. These propellants produce a nearly transparent exhaust. The same fuel was used by the core of the American Titan II rocket. The transparency of their plumes is apparent in many launch photos. The plumes of rocket engines fired in a vacuum spread out very quickly as they leave the engine nozzle (see above), further lessening their visibility. Finally, rocket engines often run \"rich\" to slow internal corrosion. On Earth, the excess fuel burns in contact with atmospheric oxygen, enhancing the visible flame. This cannot happen in a vacuum.\n\n		\n		\n\n		\n		\n\n3. The Lunar Modules weighed 17 tons and made no mark on the Moondust, yet footprints can be seen beside them.\nOn the surface of the Earth, Apollo 11\'s fueled and crewed Lunar Module, Eagle, would have weighed approximately 17 short tons (15,300 kg). On the surface of the Moon, however, after expending fuel and oxidizer on her descent from lunar orbit, the lander weighed about 2,698 pounds (1,224 kg). The astronauts were much lighter than the lander, but their boots were much smaller than the lander\'s approximately 3-foot (91 cm) diameter footpads. Pressure (or force per unit area) rather than mass determines the amount of regolith compression. In some photos, the footpads did press into the regolith, especially when they moved sideways at touchdown. (The bearing pressure under Apollo 11\'s footpads, with the lander being about 44 times the weight of an EVA-configured astronaut, would have been of similar magnitude to the bearing pressure exerted by the astronauts\' boots.)4. The air conditioning units that were part of the astronauts\' spacesuits could not have worked in an environment of no atmosphere.\nThe cooling units could only work in a vacuum. Water from a tank in the backpack flowed out through tiny pores in a metal sublimator plate where it quickly vaporized into space. The loss of the heat of vaporization froze the remaining water, forming a layer of ice on the outside of the plate that also sublimated into space (turning from a solid directly into a gas). A separate water loop flowed through the LCG (Liquid Cooling Garment) worn by the astronaut, carrying his metabolic waste heat through the sublimator plate where it was cooled and returned to the LCG. Twelve pounds (5.4 kg) of feedwater gave about eight hours of cooling; because of its bulk, it was often the limiting consumable on the length of an EVA.\n\n\n=== Transmissions ===\n1. There should have been more than a two-second delay in communications between Earth and the Moon, at a distance of 400,000 km (250,000 mi).\n\nThe round trip light travel time of more than two seconds is apparent in all the real-time recordings of the lunar audio, but this does not always appear as expected. There may also be some documentary films where the delay has been edited out. Reasons for editing the audio may be time constraints or in the interest of clarity.2. Typical delays in communication were about 0.5 seconds.\n\nClaims that the delays were only half a second are untrue, as examination of the original recordings shows. Also, there should not be a consistent time delay between every response, as the conversation is being recorded at one end – Mission Control. Responses from Mission Control could be heard without any delay, as the recording is being made at the same time that Houston receives the transmission from the Moon.3. The Parkes Observatory in Australia was billed to the world for weeks as the site that would be relaying communications from the first moonwalk. However, five hours before transmission they were told to stand down.\n\nThe timing of the first moonwalk was changed after the landing. In fact, delays in getting the moonwalk started meant that Parkes did cover almost the entire Apollo 11 moonwalk.4. Parkes supposedly had the clearest video feed from the Moon, but Australian media and all other known sources ran a live feed from the United States.\n\nWhile that was the original plan, and, according to some sources, the official policy, the Australian Broadcasting Commission (ABC) did take the transmission direct from the Parkes and Honeysuckle Creek radio telescopes. These were converted to NTSC television at Paddington, in Sydney. This meant that Australian viewers saw the moonwalk several seconds before the rest of the world. See also Parkes radio astronomer John Sarkissian\'s article, \"On Eagle\'s Wings: The Parkes Observatory\'s Support of the Apollo 11 Mission\" The events surrounding the Parkes Observatory\'s role in relaying the live television of the moonwalk were portrayed in a slightly fictionalized Australian film comedy \"The Dish\" (2000).5. Better signal was supposedly received at Parkes Observatory when the Moon was on the opposite side of the planet.\n\nThis is not supported by the detailed evidence and logs from the missions.\n\n\n=== Missing data ===\nBlueprints and design and development drawings of the machines involved are missing. Apollo 11 data tapes containing telemetry and the high-quality video (before scan conversion from slow-scan TV to standard TV) of the first moonwalk are also missing.\n\n\n==== Tapes ====\n\nDr. David R. Williams (NASA archivist at Goddard Space Flight Center) and Apollo 11 flight director Eugene F. Kranz both acknowledged that the original high-quality Apollo 11 telemetry data tapes are missing. Conspiracists see this as evidence that they never existed. The Apollo 11 telemetry tapes were different from the telemetry tapes of the other Moon landings because they contained the raw television broadcast. For technical reasons, the Apollo 11 lander carried a slow-scan television (SSTV) camera (see Apollo TV camera). To broadcast the pictures to regular television, a scan conversion had to be done. The radio telescope at Parkes Observatory in Australia was able to receive the telemetry from the Moon at the time of the Apollo 11 moonwalk. Parkes had a bigger antenna than NASA\'s antenna in Australia at the Honeysuckle Creek Tracking Station, so it received a better picture. It also received a better picture than NASA\'s antenna at Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex. This direct TV signal, along with telemetry data, was recorded onto one-inch fourteen-track analog tape at Parkes. The original SSTV transmission had better detail and contrast than the scan-converted pictures, and it is this original tape that is missing. A crude, real-time scan conversion of the SSTV signal was done in Australia before it was broadcast worldwide. However, still photos of the original SSTV image are available (see photos). About fifteen minutes of it were filmed by an amateur 8 mm film camera and these are also available. Later Apollo missions did not use SSTV. At least some of the telemetry tapes from the ALSEP scientific experiments left on the Moon (which ran until 1977) still exist, according to Dr. Williams. Copies of those tapes have been found.Others are looking for the missing telemetry tapes for different reasons. The tapes contain the original and highest quality video feed from the Apollo 11 landing. Some former Apollo personnel want to find the tapes for posterity while NASA engineers looking towards future Moon missions believe the tapes may be useful for their design studies. They have found that the Apollo 11 tapes were sent for storage at the U.S. National Archives in 1970, but by 1984, all the Apollo 11 tapes had been returned to the Goddard Space Flight Center at their request. The tapes are believed to have been stored rather than re-used. Goddard was storing 35,000 new tapes per year in 1967, even before the Moon landings.\nIn November 2006, COSMOS Online reported that about 100 data tapes recorded in Australia during the Apollo 11 mission had been found in a small marine science laboratory in the main physics building at the Curtin University of Technology in Perth, Australia. One of the old tapes has been sent to NASA for analysis. The slow-scan television images were not on the tape.In July 2009, NASA indicated that it must have erased the original Apollo 11 Moon footage years ago so that it could re-use the tape. In December 2009 NASA issued a final report on the Apollo 11 telemetry tapes. Senior engineer Dick Nafzger, who was in charge of the live TV recordings during the Apollo missions, was put in charge of the restoration project. After a three-year search, the \"inescapable conclusion\" was that about 45 tapes (estimated 15 tapes recorded at each of the three tracking stations) of Apollo 11 video were erased and re-used, said Nafzger. In time for the 40th anniversary of the Apollo 11 landing, Lowry Digital had been tasked with restoring the surviving footage. Lowry Digital president Mike Inchalik said that, \"this is by far and away the lowest quality\" video the company has dealt with. Nafzger praised Lowry for restoring \"crispness\" to the Apollo video, which will remain in black and white and contains conservative digital enhancements. The US$230,000 restoration project took months to complete and did not include sound quality improvements. Some selections of restored footage in high-definition have been made available on the NASA website.\n\n\n==== Blueprints ====\n\nGrumman appears to have destroyed most of their LM documentation, but copies of the blueprints for the Saturn V exist on microfilm.Four mission-worthy LRVs were built by Boeing. Three of them were carried to the Moon on Apollos 15, 16, and 17, and left there. After Apollo 18 was canceled, the other LRV was used for spare parts for the Apollos 15 to 17 missions. The 221-page operation manual for the LRV contains some detailed drawings, although not the blueprints.\n\n\n=== Technology ===\n\nBart Sibrel cites the relative level of the United States and USSR space technology as evidence that the Moon landings could not have happened. For much of the early stages of the Space Race, the USSR was ahead of the United States, yet in the end, the USSR was never able to fly a manned craft to the Moon, let alone land one on the surface. It is argued that, because the USSR was unable to do this, the United States should have also been unable to develop the technology to do so.\nFor example, he claims that, during the Apollo program, the USSR had five times more manned hours in space than the United States, and notes that the USSR was the first to achieve many of the early milestones in space: the first man-made satellite in orbit (October 1957, Sputnik 1); the first living creature in orbit (a dog named Laika, November 1957, Sputnik 2); the first man in space and in orbit (Yuri Gagarin, April 1961, Vostok 1); the first woman in space (Valentina Tereshkova, June 1963, Vostok 6); and the first spacewalk (EVA) (Alexei Leonov in March 1965, Voskhod 2).\nHowever, most of the Soviet gains listed above were matched by the United States within a year, and sometimes within weeks. In 1965, the United States started to achieve many firsts (such as the first successful space rendezvous), which were important steps in a mission to the Moon. Furthermore, NASA and others say that these gains by the Soviets are not as impressive as they seem; that a number of these firsts were mere stunts that did not advance the technology greatly, or at all, e.g., the first woman in space. In fact, by the time of the launch of the first manned Earth-orbiting Apollo flight (Apollo 7), the USSR had made only nine spaceflights (seven with one cosmonaut, one with two, one with three) compared to 16 by the United States. In terms of spacecraft hours, the USSR had 460 hours of spaceflight; the United States had 1,024 hours. In terms of astronaut/cosmonaut time, the USSR had 534 hours of manned spaceflight whereas the United States had 1,992 hours. By the time of Apollo 11, the United States had a lead much wider than that. (See List of human spaceflights, 1961–1970, and refer to individual flights for the length of time.)\nMoreover, the USSR did not develop a successful rocket capable of a manned lunar mission until the 1980s – their N1 rocket failed on all four launch attempts between 1969 and 1972. The Soviet LK lunar lander was tested in unmanned low-Earth-orbit flights three times in 1970 and 1971.\n\n\n=== Deaths of NASA personnel ===\nIn a televised program about the moon-landing hoax allegations, Fox Entertainment Group listed the deaths of ten astronauts and two civilians related to the manned spaceflight program as part of an alleged cover-up.\n\nTheodore Freeman (killed ejecting from a T-38 which had suffered a bird strike, October 1964)\nElliot See and Charlie Bassett (T-38 crash in bad weather, February 1966)\nVirgil \"Gus\" Grissom, Ed White, and Roger B. Chaffee (killed in a fire during the \"plugs-out test\" preceding Apollo 1, January 1967)\nEdward \"Ed\" Givens (killed in a car accident, June 1967)\nClifton \"C. C.\" Williams (killed ejecting from a T-38, October 1967)\nMichael J. \"Mike\" Adams (died in an X-15 crash, November 1967. Adams was the only pilot killed during the X-15 flight test program. He was a test pilot, not a NASA astronaut, but had flown the X-15 above 50 miles.)\nRobert Henry Lawrence, Jr. (killed in an F-104 crash, December 1967, shortly after being selected as a pilot with the United States Air Force\'s (later cancelled) Manned Orbiting Laboratory (MOL) program.)\nThomas Ronald Baron (North American Aviation employee. Baron died in an automobile collision with a train, April 27, 1967, six days after testifying before Rep. Olin E. Teague\'s House Subcommittee on NASA Oversight hearings held following the Apollo 1 fire, after which he was fired). Baron was a quality control inspector who wrote a report critical of the Apollo program and was an outspoken critic of NASA\'s safety record after the Apollo 1 fire. Baron and his family were killed as their car was struck by a train at a train crossing. The deaths were an accident.\nBrian D. Welch, a leading official in NASA\'s Public Affairs Office and Director of Media Services (Welch died a few months after appearing in the media to debunk the pro-hoax television show cited above. He died of a heart attack at the age of 42.Two of the above, X-15 pilot Mike Adams and MOL pilot Robert Lawrence, had no connection with the civilian manned space program that oversaw the Apollo missions. All of the deaths listed besides Welch occurred at least 20 months before Apollo 11 and subsequent flights.\nAs of  November 2018, four of the twelve Apollo astronauts who landed on the Moon between 1969 and 1972 are still alive, including Buzz Aldrin. Also, nine of the twelve Apollo astronauts who flew to the Moon without landing between 1968 and 1972 are still alive, including Michael Collins.\nThe number of deaths within the American astronaut corps during the run-up to Apollo and during the Apollo missions is similar to the number of deaths incurred by the Russians. During the period 1961 to 1972, at least eight Russian serving and former cosmonauts died:\n\nValentin Bondarenko (ground training accident, March 1961)\nGrigori Nelyubov (suicide, February 1966)\nVladimir Komarov (Soyuz 1 accident, April 1967)\nYuri Gagarin (MiG-15 crash, March 1968)\nPavel Belyayev (complications following surgery, January 1970)\nGeorgi Dobrovolski, Vladislav Volkov, and Viktor Patsayev (Soyuz 11 accident, June 1971)Additionally, the overall chief of their manned-spaceflight program, Sergei Korolev, died while undergoing surgery in January 1966.\n\n\n=== NASA response ===\nIn June 1977, NASA issued a fact sheet responding to recent claims that the Apollo Moon landings had been hoaxed. The fact sheet is particularly blunt and regards the idea of faking the Moon landings to be preposterous and outlandish. NASA refers to the rocks and particles collected from the Moon as being evidence of the program\'s legitimacy, as they claim that these rocks could not have been formed under conditions on earth. NASA also notes that all of the operations and phases of the Apollo program were closely followed and under the scrutiny of the news media, from liftoff to splashdown. NASA responds to Bill Kaysing\'s book, We Never Went to the Moon, by identifying one of his claims of fraud regarding the lack of a crater left on the Moon\'s surface by the landing of the lunar module, and refuting it with facts about the soil and cohesive nature of the surface of the Moon.\nThe fact sheet was reissued on February 14, 2001, the day before Fox television\'s broadcast of Conspiracy Theory: Did We Land on the Moon? The documentary reinvigorated the public\'s interest in conspiracy theories and the possibility that the Moon landings were faked, which has provoked NASA to once again defend its name.\n\n\n=== Alleged Stanley Kubrick involvement ===\nFilmmaker Stanley Kubrick is accused of having produced much of the footage for Apollos 11 and 12, presumably because he had just directed 2001: A Space Odyssey, which is partly set on the Moon and featured advanced special effects. It has been claimed that when 2001 was in post-production in early 1968, NASA secretly approached Kubrick to direct the first three Moon landings. The launch and splashdown would be real but the spacecraft would stay in Earth orbit and fake footage broadcast as \"live from the Moon.\" No evidence was offered for this theory, which overlooks many facts. For example, 2001 was released before the first Apollo landing and Kubrick\'s depiction of the Moon\'s surface differs greatly from its appearance in the Apollo footage. The movement of characters on the Moon in 2001 differs from that of the filmed movement of Apollo astronauts, and does not resemble an environment with 1/6 the gravity of Earth. Several scenes in 2001 show dust billowing as spacecraft landed, something that would not happen in the vacuum environment of the Moon. Kubrick did hire Frederick Ordway and Harry Lange, both of whom had worked for NASA and major aerospace contractors, to work with him on 2001. Kubrick also used some 50 mm f/0.7 lenses that were left over from a batch made by Zeiss for NASA. However, Kubrick only got this lens for Barry Lyndon (1975). The lens was originally a still photo lens and needed changes to be used for motion filming.\nThe mockumentary based on this idea, Dark Side of the Moon, could have fueled the conspiracy theory. This French mockumentary, directed by William Karel, was originally aired on Arte channel in 2002 with the title Opération Lune. It parodies conspiracy theories with faked interviews, stories of assassinations of Stanley Kubrick\'s assistants by the CIA, and a variety of conspicuous mistakes, puns, and references to old movie characters, inserted through the film as clues for the viewer. Nevertheless, Opération Lune is still taken at face value by some conspiracy believers.\nAn article entitled \"Stanley Kubrick and the Moon Hoax\" appeared on Usenet in 1995, in the newsgroup \"alt.humor.best-of-usenet\". One passage – on how Kubrick was supposedly coerced into the conspiracy – reads:\n\nNASA further leveraged their position by threatening to publicly reveal the heavy involvement of Mr. Kubrick\'s younger brother, Raul, with the American Communist Party. This would have been an intolerable embarrassment to Mr. Kubrick, especially since the release of Dr. Strangelove.\nKubrick had no such brother – the article was a spoof, complete with a giveaway sentence describing Kubrick shooting the moonwalk \"on location\" on the Moon. Nevertheless, the claim was taken up in earnest; Clyde Lewis used it almost word-for-word, whereas Jay Weidner gave the brother a more senior status within the party:\n\nNo one knows how the powers-that-be convinced Kubrick to direct the Apollo landings. Maybe they had compromised Kubrick in some way. The fact that his brother, Raul Kubrick, was the head of the American Communist Party may have been one of the avenues pursued by the government to get Stanley to cooperate.\nIn July 2009, Weidner posted on his webpage \"Secrets of the Shining\", where he states that Kubrick\'s The Shining (1980) is a veiled confession of his role in the scam project. This thesis was subject of refutation in an article published on Seeker nearly half a year later.The 2015 movie Moonwalkers is a fictional account of a CIA agent\'s claim of Kubrick\'s involvement.\nIn December 2015, a video surfaced which allegedly shows Kubrick being interviewed shortly before his 1999 death; the video purportedly shows the director confessing to T. Patrick Murray that the Apollo Moon landings had been faked. Research quickly found, however, that the video was a hoax.\n\n\n=== Academic work ===\nIn 2002, NASA granted US$15,000 to James Oberg for a commission to write a point-by-point rebuttal of the hoax claims. However, NASA canceled the commission later that year, after complaints that the book would dignify the accusations. Oberg said that he meant to finish the book. In November 2002, Peter Jennings said \"NASA is going to spend a few thousand dollars trying to prove to some people that the United States did indeed land men on the Moon,\" and \"NASA had been so rattled, [they] hired [somebody] to write a book refuting the conspiracy theorists.\" Oberg says that belief in the hoax theories is not the fault of the conspiracists, but rather that of teachers and people (including NASA) who should provide information to the public.In 2004, Martin Hendry and Ken Skeldon of the University of Glasgow were awarded a grant by the UK-based Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council to investigate Moon landing conspiracy theories. In November 2004, they gave a lecture at the Glasgow Science Centre where the top ten claims by conspiracists were individually addressed and refuted.\n\n\n=== MythBusters special ===\n\nAn episode of MythBusters in August 2008 was dedicated to the Moon landings. The MythBusters crew tested many of the conspiracists\' claims. Some of the testings were done in a NASA training facility. All of the conspiracists\' claims examined on the show were labeled as having been \"Busted\", meaning that the conspiracists\' claims were not true.\n\n\n== Third-party evidence of Moon landings ==\n\n\n=== Imaging the landing sites ===\n\nMoon-landing conspiracists claim that observatories and the Hubble Space Telescope should be able to photograph the landing sites. This implies that the world\'s major observatories (as well as the Hubble Program) are complicit in the hoax by refusing to take photos of the landing sites. Photos of the Moon have been taken by Hubble, including at least two Apollo landing sites, but the Hubble resolution limits viewing of lunar objects to sizes no smaller than 60–75 yards (55–69 meters), which is insufficient resolution to see any landing site features.In April 2001, Leonard David published an article on space.com, which showed a photo taken by the Clementine mission showing a diffuse dark spot at the site NASA says is the Apollo 15 lander. The evidence was noticed by Misha Kreslavsky, of the Department of Geological Sciences at Brown University, and Yuri Shkuratov of the Kharkiv Astronomical Observatory in Ukraine. The European Space Agency\'s SMART-1 unmanned probe sent back photos of the landing sites, according to Bernard Foing, Chief Scientist of the ESA Science Program. \"Given SMART-1\'s initial high orbit, however, it may prove difficult to see artifacts,\" said Foing in an interview on space.com.\nIn 2002, Alex R. Blackwell of the University of Hawaii pointed out that some photos taken by Apollo astronauts while in orbit around the Moon show the landing sites.\nThe Daily Telegraph published a story in 2002 saying that European astronomers at the Very Large Telescope (VLT) would use it to view the landing sites. According to the article, Dr. Richard West said that his team would take \"a high-resolution image of one of the Apollo landing sites.\" Marcus Allen, a conspiracist, answered that no photos of hardware on the Moon would convince him that manned landings had happened. As the VLT is capable of resolving equivalent to the distance between the headlights of a car as seen from the Moon, it may be able to photograph some features of the landing sites. Such photos, if and when they become available, would be the first non-NASA-produced photos of the sites at that definition.\nThe Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) launched their SELENE Moon orbiter on September 14, 2007 (JST), from Tanegashima Space Center. SELENE orbited the Moon at about 100 kilometres (62 mi) altitude. In May 2008, JAXA reported detecting the \"halo\" generated by the Apollo 15 Lunar Module engine exhaust from a Terrain Camera image. A three-dimensional reconstructed photo also matched the terrain of an Apollo 15 photo taken from the surface.\nOn July 17, 2009, NASA released low-resolution engineering test photos of the Apollo 11, Apollo 14, Apollo 15, Apollo 16 and Apollo 17 landing sites that have been photographed by the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter as part of the process of starting its primary mission. The photos show the descent stage of the landers from each mission on the Moon\'s surface. The photo of the Apollo 14 landing site also shows tracks made by an astronaut between a science experiment (ALSEP) and the lander. Photos of the Apollo 12 landing site were released by NASA on September 3, 2009. The Intrepid lander descent stage, experiment package (ALSEP), Surveyor 3 spacecraft, and astronaut footpaths are all visible. While the LRO images have been enjoyed by the scientific community as a whole, they have not done anything to convince conspiracists that the landings happened.On September 1, 2009, India\'s lunar mission Chandrayaan-1 took photos of the Apollo 15 landing site and tracks of the lunar rovers. The Indian Space Research Organisation launched their unmanned lunar probe on September 8, 2008 (IST), from Satish Dhawan Space Centre. The photos were taken by a hyperspectral camera fitted as part of the mission\'s image payload.China\'s second lunar probe, Chang\'e 2, which was launched in 2010, can photograph the lunar surface with a resolution of up to 1.3 meters (4.3 feet). It spotted traces of the Apollo landings.\n\n\n=== Moon rocks ===\n\nThe Apollo program collected 380 kilograms (838 lb) of Moon rocks during the six manned missions. Analyses by scientists worldwide all agree that these rocks came from the Moon – no published accounts in peer-reviewed scientific journals exist that dispute this claim. The Apollo samples are easily distinguishable from both meteorites and Earth rocks in that they show a lack of hydrous alteration products, they show evidence of having undergone impact events on an airless body, and they have unique geochemical traits. Furthermore, most are more than 200 million years older than the oldest Earth rocks. The Moon rocks also share the same traits as Soviet samples.Conspiracists argue that Marshall Space Flight Center Director Wernher von Braun\'s trip to Antarctica in 1967 (about two years before the Apollo 11 launch) was to gather lunar meteorites to be used as fake Moon rocks. Because von Braun was a former SS officer (though one who had been detained by the Gestapo), the documentary film Did We Go? suggests that he could have been pressured to agree to the conspiracy to protect himself from recriminations over his past. NASA said that von Braun\'s mission was \"to look into environmental and logistic factors that might relate to the planning of future space missions, and hardware.\" NASA continues to send teams to work in Antarctica to mimic the conditions on other planets.\nIt is now accepted by the scientific community that rocks have been blasted from both the Martian and lunar surface during impact events, and that some of these have landed on the Earth as meteorites. However, the first Antarctic lunar meteorite was found in 1979, and its lunar origin was not recognized until 1982. Furthermore, lunar meteorites are so rare that it is unlikely that they could account for the 380 kilograms of Moon rocks that NASA gathered between 1969 and 1972. Only about 30 kilograms of lunar meteorites have been found on Earth thus far, despite private collectors and governmental agencies worldwide searching for more than 20 years.While the Apollo missions gathered 380 kilograms of Moon rocks, the Soviet Luna 16, Luna 20 and Luna 24 robots gathered only 326 grams combined (that is, less than one-thousandth as much). Indeed, current plans for a Martian sample return would only gather about 500 grams of soil, and a recently proposed South Pole-Aitken basin robot mission would only gather about 1 kilogram of Moon rock. If NASA had used similar robot technology, then between 300 and 2,000 robot missions would have been needed to collect the current amount of Moon rocks that is held by NASA.\nOn the makeup of the Moon rocks, Kaysing asked: \"Why was there never a mention of gold, silver, diamonds or other precious metals on the moon? Wasn\'t this a viable consideration? Why was this fact never dicussed [sic] in the press or by the astronauts?\" Geologists realize that gold and silver deposits on Earth are the result of the action of hydrothermal fluids concentrating the precious metals into veins of ore. Since in 1969 water was believed to be absent on the Moon, no geologist would bother discussing the possibility of finding these on the Moon in any great amount.\n\n\n=== Missions tracked by independent parties ===\n\nAside from NASA, a number of groups and individuals tracked the Apollo missions as they happened. On later missions, NASA released information to the public explaining where and when the spacecraft could be sighted. Their flight paths were tracked using radar and they were sighted and photographed using telescopes. Also, radio transmissions between the astronauts on the surface and in orbit were independently recorded.\n\n\n=== Retroreflectors ===\n\nThe presence of retroreflectors (mirrors used as targets for Earth-based tracking lasers) from the Laser Ranging Retroreflector Experiment (LRRR) is evidence that there were landings. Lick Observatory attempted to detect from Apollo 11\'s retroreflector while Armstrong and Aldrin were still on the Moon but did not succeed until August 1, 1969. The Apollo 14 astronauts deployed a retroreflector on February 5, 1971, and McDonald Observatory detected it the same day. The Apollo 15 retroreflector was deployed on July 31, 1971, and was detected by McDonald Observatory within a few days. Smaller retroreflectors were also put on the Moon by the Russians; they were attached to the unmanned lunar rovers Lunokhod 1 and Lunokhod 2.\n\n\n== Public opinion ==\n\nIn a 1994 poll by The Washington Post, 9% of the respondents said that it was possible that astronauts did not go to the Moon and another 5% were unsure. A 1999 Gallup Poll found that 6% of the Americans surveyed doubted that the Moon landings happened and that 5% of those surveyed had no opinion, which roughly matches the findings of a similar 1995 Time/CNN poll. Officials of the Fox network said that such skepticism rose to about 20% after the February 2001 airing of their network\'s television special, Conspiracy Theory: Did We Land on the Moon?, seen by about 15 million viewers. This Fox special is seen as having promoted the hoax claims.A 2000 poll conducted by the Public Opinion Foundation (ФОМ) in Russia found that 28% of those surveyed did not believe that American astronauts landed on the Moon, and this percentage is roughly equal in all social-demographic groups. In 2009, a poll held by the United Kingdom\'s Engineering & Technology magazine found that 25% of those surveyed did not believe that men landed on the Moon. Another poll gives that 25% of 18- to 25-year-olds surveyed were unsure that the landings happened.There are subcultures worldwide which advocate the belief that the Moon landings were faked. By 1977 the Hare Krishna magazine Back to Godhead called the landings a hoax, claiming that, since the Sun is 93,000,000 miles away, and \"according to Hindu mythology the Moon is 800,000 miles farther away than that\", the Moon would be nearly 94,000,000 miles away; to travel that span in 91 hours would require a speed of more than a million miles per hour, \"a patently impossible feat even by the scientists\' calculations.\"James Oberg of ABC News said that the conspiracy theory is taught in Cuban schools and wherever Cuban teachers are sent. A poll conducted in the 1970s by the United States Information Agency in several countries in Latin America, Asia, and Africa found that most respondents were unaware of the Moon landings, many of the others dismissed them as propaganda or science fiction, and many thought that it had been the Russians that landed on the Moon.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nAstronauts Gone Wild\nIn the Shadow of the Moon\nLost Cosmonauts\nList of topics characterized as pseudoscience\nStolen and missing moon rocks\nGreat Moon Hoax\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Citations ==\n This article incorporates public domain material from websites or documents of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nLoxton, Daniel (2010). \"Top Ten Busted Myths\".

The UFO was identified as a \"flying weapon\" that helped the Thai king win in battle.\n\n\n== 20th century ==\nDr. Debhanom Muangman, the former Dean of Faculty of Public Health at Mahidol University and Harvard University alumni, claimed extraterrestrial contact after a “Grey” came into his bedroom in Si Yan, Bangkok. In the 1950s, he studied in the United States. Dr. Muangman claimed he saw a UFO in the sky over New Hampshire. He continues to study paranormal phenomena, including ghosts, spirits, psychic experiences and reincarnation. He is currently the president of the Thailand Association for Psychological Research (สมาคมค้นคว้าทางจิตแห่งประเทศไทย).

(137, 'Carson Sink UFO incident', 'The Carson Sink Case is a UFO incident alleged by John L. McGinn and John R. Barton, two United States Air Force Colonels, to have taken place near Carson Sink in western Nevada in the United States while they were en route from California to Colorado in a B-25 on July 24, 1952. Both colonels worked at the Pentagon at the time with assignments that would have made them very familiar with military aircraft of the era, both domestic and foreign. The aircraft were also reported as being seen by hundreds of residents.\n\n\n== Event ==\nOn July 24, 1952, two Air Force colonels requisitioned a twin-engine B-25 bomber at Hamilton Field north of San Francisco for a flight to Colorado Springs, Colorado. At 3:40 P.M. Mountain Time, while flying at 11,000 feet (3,400 m) with a speed of 180 knots (330 km/h) over Carson Sink, the two pilots saw three unknown aircraft ahead of them and to their right. At first, the two thought the aircraft were F-86 jets but determined that the aircraft were flying too high for that to be the case. On top of this, the pilots reported the aircraft to be flying in a V-formation, which was abnormal for military aircraft at the time.Within seconds, the aircraft had come close enough to the B-25 that the pilots could determine the unidentified aircraft to be bright silver, delta wing aircraft that were lacking tails and pilot\'s canopies. The colonels also reported that the aircraft had a ridge that ran from nose to tail. The aircraft then made a sharp left turn, passing within 800 yards (730 m) of the B-25 before flying off in what the pilots estimated to be a speed that was three-times the speed of an F-86, placing them out of sight within four seconds.Upon landing in Colorado Springs, the pilots reported the incident to Air Defense Command headquarters, who told them that no civilian or military aircraft had been anywhere near Carson Sink at the time they were passing over the area. The closest known delta wing aircraft were on the West Coast at the time. On top of this, the Navy aircraft were painted to be dark blue.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nAir Defense Command reported the incident to Project Blue Book, but it remained unexplained. In his subsequent book, The Report on Unidentified Flying Objects, Edward Ruppelt characterized it as a \"good UFO report with an unknown conclusion\". Both pilots continued to dismiss the idea that the aircraft were F-86s. The investigation also looked into balloons, both weather balloons and research balloons that can be up to 100 feet (30 m) wide, but there were no known balloons in the area, either.\nBoth of the pilots had friends who themselves had reported flying saucers. McGinn and Barton expressed skepticism of these reports previous to the incident, but upon being interviewed in Colorado Springs they reported they had changed their opinions.\n\n\n== See also ==\nNorthrop_YB-35\nCarson Sink\nList of UFO sightings\nUFO\n\n\n== References ==', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1e/2015-04-18_14_47_11_View_southeast_from_Topog_Peak%2C_Nevada.jpg'),

(139, 'Westall UFO', 'The Westall UFO encounter is an event that occurred on 6 April 1966 in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Around 11:00 am, for about 20 minutes, more than 200 students and teachers at two Victorian state schools allegedly witnessed an unexplained flying object which descended into a nearby open wild grass field. The paddock was adjacent to a grove of pine trees in an area known as The Grange (now a nature reserve). According to reports, the object then ascended in a north-westerly direction over the suburb of Clayton South, Victoria, Australia.\n\n\n== Description ==\nAt approximately 11:00 am on Wednesday, 6 April 1966, a class of students and a teacher from Westall High School (now Westall Secondary College) were just completing a sport activity on the main oval when an object, described as being a grey saucer-shaped craft with a slight purple hue and being about twice the size of a family car, was alleged to have been seen. Witness descriptions were mixed: Andrew Greenwood, a science teacher, told The Dandenong Journal at the time that he saw a silvery-green disc. According to witnesses the object was descending and then crossed and overflew the high school\'s south-west corner, going in a south-easterly direction, before disappearing from sight as it descended behind a stand of trees and into a paddock at The Grange in front of the Westall State School (primary students). After a short period (approximately 20 minutes) the object – with witnesses now numbering over 200 – then climbed at speed and departed towards the north-west. As the object gained altitude some accounts describe it as having been pursued from the scene by five unidentified aircraft which circled the object. Some described one disk, some claimed to have seen three.\n\n\n== Media ==\nThe Dandenong Journal covered the encounter in detail and ran two front-page stories. The first was on 14 April. and the next was on 21 April.Broadsheet newspaper, The Age ran a very small article about the Westall incident on 7 April 1966, on page 6:\n\"Object Perhaps Balloon – An unidentified flying object seen over the Clayton-Moorabbin area yesterday morning might have been a weather balloon. Hundreds of children and a number of teachers at Westall School, Clayton, watched the object during morning break.\"\nThe newspaper also said a number of small aeroplanes circled around it. However, a check later showed that no commercial, private or RAAF pilots had reported anything unusual in the area.\nThe Weather Bureau released a balloon at Laverton at 8:30 am and the westerly wind blowing at the time could have moved it into the area where the sighting was reported\". Witnesses and researchers were surprised when The Sun News-Pictorial (a tabloid) ran no story, yet The Age (a broadsheet) did.\nThe Sun and The Herald newspapers, while not mentioning the Westall incident, both published cartoons in the following day\'s editions that made light of the flying saucer phenomena.Studio 10 (a TV program) made a 17 min summary on the 50 year anniversary of the event in January 2016 with interviews of eyewitnesses.A 7 minute short entitled Westall was produced in 2017 as part of a Swinburne University of Technology project. It featured interviews with 3 of the children that witnessed the event.\n\n\n== Unofficial investigation ==\nThe alleged sighting was investigated by two groups: The Victorian Flying Saucer Research Society (VFSRS) and Phenomena Research Australia (PRA). Both groups described it as being one of Australia\'s major unexplained UFO cases. The VFSRS team arrived on the site on 8 April and spoke to students and viewed the \"ground mark\", originally described as a great big round patch of yellow flattened grass with a swirly pattern. The VFSRS printed an image and a small report in their magazine \"Australian UFO Bulletin\" in December 2000. An investigator, Brian Boyle (PRA), arrived at the site on 9 April with four army investigators. Boyle did a number of interviews, which he recorded on tape, over a number of days and took samples from the ground mark. These investigators were able to speak to many of the witnesses as it was over the Easter holidays (8–11 April).\n\n\n== Proposed explanations ==\nAlthough some witnesses reported five Cessna-type aircraft around the object, investigators were unable to find any record of such aircraft. Moorabbin Airport, which is 4.76 km (south-west) from the location, was checked but no aircraft from that airport entered the airspace. The RAAF also reported no military activity in that area.The Australian Skeptics described the object as potentially having been an experimental military aircraft. They suggest that it may have been a nylon target drogue, like a wind sock, towed by one plane for the others to chase and known to be in use by the local RAAF at the time.\n\n\n== Reunion ==\nA witness reunion was held at Westall Tennis Club Hall, on 8 April 2006, to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the incident.\n\n\n== Recent media ==\n\n\n=== Documentary ===\nA 50-minute HDTV documentary called Westall ‘66: A Suburban UFO Mystery first aired on Australian TV on 4 June 2010.\nOn 4 June 2010 a Seven Network TV program, Today Tonight, produced a segment about the Westall case and documentary.\nIt was also covered in Close Encounters.\nOn 21 January 2016 Channel 10 (Australia) program Studio 10 screened a segment titled: \"21 Jan – Melbourne UFO Mystery: 50 Years On\" (17mins:31secs) which included live interviews with witnesses who were children at the local school, in suburban Melbourne, back in 1966.\nInvasion Earth Season 1, Episode 5 has a 15-minute segment dedicated to the event and interviews 4 separate eyewitnesses saying some teachers refused to be interviewed.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAustralian Ufology\nBass Strait Triangle\nList of UFO sightings\nUFO sightings in Australia\nDisappearance of Frederick Valentich\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nDunning, Brian. \"Skeptoid #208: The Westall \'66 UFO\".

Israel claimed that the UFOs were also seen by a nearby barangay, and possibly residents of Parañaque City.\n\n\n== 2004 Las Piñas UFO incident ==\nMore than 10 UFOs were seen in Las Piñas at around 7 p.m. Saturday, August 28, 2004. Three children noticed two unusual reddish-etheric glares moving above some partly cloudy skies from their residence in Mabolo St., Verdant Acres, Pamplona, Las Piñas City.\nThe first object they saw headed east to where the moon sits around that time. Another two emerged and three more objects appeared from the western horizon. \"These unusual objects could not be mere airplanes because two of them were already pretty close to the moon,\" exclaimed 11-year-old Nica Canarias as she apparently had the impression that the objects were heading to the moon.\nNica, the eldest in the Canarias siblings and one of the early witnesses, immediately called her nine-year-old friend Adrian Israel. Adrian - whom the Canarias knew as a UFO experiencer is the son of Antonio (Tony) Israel, who took video footage of UFOs above the Las Piñas skies back on September 3, 2000.\nAdrian confirmed that these objects were similar to those he saw four years ago.

He was joined by his neighbors who watched while the objects moved erratically, jerking, floating and jumping in various directions.\nFrom 7:30 to 8:15pm, Israel was shooting videos of at least five UFOs - each emerging from the horizon at time intervals of approximately eight minutes.\nIsrael told ABS-CBN that he was now more composed in aiming his video camera at the subjects compared to his first encounter. He added, \"I learned a big lesson from the previous investigations made by the PAGASA UFO Investigating Team (Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration) and from criticisms telling that in my first UFO encounter, the video lacked panning that’s why there was no referential point to approximate size and distance. So from this chance, I think I panned well-enough and a probable estimation of the objects\' altitude and size could be established.\"\n\n\n== 2011 Bulacan UFO incident ==\nA couple of UFOs were seen in Bulacan in the first week of May. But it disappeared and never seen. On May 27, people caught a sight of two UFOs in the middle of the night. Same as the September 2000 UFO sightings, it was red and large like a basketball. Some people said that one of them was at the east and the other at the west, colliding each other and then disappeared.\n\n\n== Cavite sightings ==\nThere were UFO sightings in Cavite in 2011.\nAnother sighting occurred on May 16, 2018. Witness said he saw two luminous light which came from a distant star. It looked like it left the star and followed what seems like a diagonal route according to the witness.\nUnfortunately, no other person saw the phenomena thus, no one can confirm what the witness said.\n\n\n== Alleged \"UFO\" sighted in Pampanga ==\nThe alleged \"UFO\" was sighted on evening of April 26, 2015 was quickly circulated across the Facebook. The video shows the motionless lights was apparently floating in the sky. According to the person who took the video, while they in Lubao-Pampanga diversion road, they notice that the lights later formed a letter \"V\". At first, they only saw three lights until the lights are appeared seven more. Later, the lights vanishes a little bit. The next morning, they returned to the area where the lights appeared in the sky; there is no buildings situated in this area. The video was shown by PAGASA, according to them, they estimate about 800–1000 meters high from the ground. Also, PAGASA states that is impossible that the lights coming from the airplane, hot air balloon, or drones due to its size of the lights. The lights appeared in 5–8 minutes based on the concept of eyewitnesses.\n\n\n== Notes ==', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e8/Crystal_Clear_app_kedit.svg'),
(142, 'Nazi UFOs', 'In Ufology, conspiracy theory, science fiction, and comic book stories, claims or stories have circulated linking UFOs to Nazi Germany. The German UFO theories describe supposedly successful attempts to develop advanced aircraft or spacecraft prior to and during World War II, and further assert the post-war survival of these craft in secret underground bases in Antarctica, South America, or the United States, along with their creators. According to these theories and fictional stories, various potential code-names or sub-classifications of Nazi UFO craft such as Rundflugzeug, Feuerball, Diskus, Haunebu, Hauneburg-Gerät, V7, Vril, Kugelblitz (not related to the self-propelled anti-aircraft gun of the same name), Andromeda-Gerät, Flugkreisel, Kugelwaffe, and Reichsflugscheibe have all been referenced.\nAccounts appear as early as 1950, likely inspired by historical German development of specialized engines such as Viktor Schauberger\'s \"Repulsine\" around the time of World War II. Elements of these claims have been widely incorporated into various works of fictional and purportedly non-fictional media, including video games and documentaries, often mixed with more substantiated information.\nGerman UFO literature very often conforms largely to documented history on the following points:\n\nNazi Germany claimed the territory of New Swabia in Antarctica, sent an expedition there in 1938, and planned others.\nNazi Germany conducted research into advanced propulsion technology, including rocketry, Viktor Schauberger\'s engine research, flying wing craft and the Arthur Sack A.S.6 experimental circular winged aircraft.\nSome UFO sightings during World War II, particularly those known as foo fighters, were thought by the Allies to be prototype enemy aircraft designed to harass Allied aircraft through electromagnetic disruption; a technology similar to today\'s electromagnetic pulse (EMP) weapons.\n\n\n== Early claims ==\nIn World War II, the so-called \"foo fighters\", a variety of unusual and anomalous aerial phenomena, were witnessed by both Axis and Allied personnel. While some foo fighter reports were dismissed as the misperceptions of troops in the heat of combat, others were taken seriously, and leading scientists such as Luis Alvarez began to investigate them.  In at least some cases, Allied intelligence and commanders suspected that foo fighters reported in the European theater represented advanced German aircraft or weapons, particularly given that Germans had already developed such technological innovations as V-1 and V-2 rockets and the first operational jet-powered Me 262 fighter planes, and that a minority of foo fighters seemed to have inflicted damage to allied aircraft.Similar sentiments regarding German technology resurfaced in 1947 with the first wave of flying saucer reports after Kenneth Arnold\'s widely reported close encounter with nine crescent-shaped objects moving at a high velocity. Personnel of Project Sign, the first U.S. Air Force UFO investigation group, noted that the advanced flying wing aeronautical designs of the German Horten brothers were similar to some UFO reports. In 1959, Captain Edward J. Ruppelt, the first head of Project Blue Book (Project Sign\'s follow-up investigation) wrote:\n\nWhen WWII ended, the Germans had several radical types of aircraft and guided missiles under development. The majority were in the most preliminary stages, but they were the only known craft that could even approach the performance of objects reported by UFO observers.\nWhile these early speculations and reports were limited primarily to military personnel, the earliest assertion of German flying saucers in the mass media appears to have been an article which appeared in the Italian newspaper Il Giornale d\'Italia in early 1950. Written by Professor Giuseppe Belluzzo, an Italian scientist and a former Italian Minister of National Economy under the Mussolini regime, it claimed that \"types of flying discs were designed and studied in Germany and Italy as early as 1942\". Belluzzo also expressed the opinion that \"some great power is launching discs to study them\".The Bell UFO was among the first flying objects to be connected with the Nazis. It apparently had occult markings on it and it was also rumoured to have been very similar to a Wehrmacht document about a vertical take off aircraft. It is directly related to the supposed crash of a bell-shaped object that occurred in Kecksburg, Pennsylvania, USA on December 9, 1965. The same month, German engineer Rudolf Schriever gave an interview to German news magazine Der Spiegel in which he claimed that he had designed a craft powered by a circular plane of rotating turbine blades 49 ft (15 m) in diameter. He said that the project had been developed by him and his team at BMW\'s Prague works until April 1945, when he fled Czechoslovakia. His designs for the disk and a model were stolen from his workshop in Bremerhaven-Lehe in 1948 and he was convinced that Czech agents had built his craft for \"a foreign power\". In a separate interview with Der Spiegel in October 1952 he said that the plans were stolen from a farm he was hiding in near Regen on 14 May 1945. There are other discrepancies between the two interviews that add to the confusion. However, many skeptics have doubted that such a Bell UFO was actually designed or ever built.In 1953, when Avro Canada announced that it was developing the VZ-9-AV Avrocar, a circular jet aircraft with an estimated speed of 1,500 mph (2,400 km/h), German engineer Georg Klein claimed that such designs had been developed during the Nazi era. Klein identified two types of supposed German flying disks:\n\nA non-rotating disk developed at Breslau by V-2 rocket engineer Richard Miethe, which was captured by the Soviets, while Miethe fled to the US via France, and ended up working for Avro.\nA disk developed by Rudolf Schriever and Klaus Habermohl at Prague, which consisted of a ring of moving turbine blades around a fixed cockpit. Klein claimed that he had witnessed this craft\'s first manned flight on 14 February 1945, when it managed to climb to 12,400 m (40,700 ft) in 3 minutes and attained a speed of 2,200 km/h (1,400 mph) in level flight.\nAeronautical engineer Roy Fedden remarked that the only craft that could approach the capabilities attributed to flying saucers were those being designed by the Germans towards the end of the war. Fedden (who was also chief of the technical mission to Germany for the Ministry of Aircraft Production) stated in 1945: I have seen enough of their designs and production plans to realize that if they (the Germans) had managed to prolong the war some months longer, we would have been confronted with a set of entirely new and deadly developments in air warfare.\nFedden also added that the Germans were working on a number of very unusual aeronautical projects, though he did not elaborate upon his statement.\n\n\n== Later claims ==\n\n\n=== The Morning of the Magicians ===\nLe Matin des Magiciens (\"The Morning of the Magicians\"), a 1960 book by Louis Pauwels and Jacques Bergier, made many spectacular claims about the Vril Society of Berlin. Several years later writers, including Jan van Helsing, Norbert-Jürgen Ratthofer, and Vladimir Terziski, have built on their work, connecting the Vril Society with UFOs. Among their claims, they imply that the society may have made contact with an alien race and dedicated itself to creating spacecraft to reach the aliens. In partnership with the Thule Society and the Nazi Party, the Vril Society developed a series of flying disc prototypes. With the Nazi defeat, the society allegedly retreated to a base in Antarctica and vanished into the hollow Earth to meet up with the leaders of an advanced race inhabiting inner Earth.\n\n\n=== Ernst Zündel\'s marketing ploy ===\n\nWhen German Holocaust denier Ernst Zündel started Samisdat Publishers in the 1970s, he initially catered to the UFOlogy community, which was then at its peak of public acceptance. His books claimed that flying saucers were Nazi secret weapons launched from an underground base in Antarctica, from which the Nazis hoped to conquer the Earth and possibly the planets. Zündel also sold (for $9999) seats on an exploration team to locate the polar entrance to the hollow earth. Some who interviewed Zündel claim that he privately admitted it was a deliberate hoax to build publicity for Samisdat, although he still defended it as late as 2002.\n\n\n=== Miguel Serrano\'s book ===\nIn 1978, Miguel Serrano, a Chilean diplomat and Nazi sympathizer, published El Cordón Dorado: Hitlerismo Esotérico [The Golden Thread: Esoteric Hitlerism] (in Spanish), in which he claimed that Adolf Hitler was an Avatar of Vishnu and was, at that time, communing with Hyperborean gods in an underground Antarctic base in New Swabia. Serrano predicted that Hitler would lead a fleet of UFOs from the base to establish the Fourth Reich. In popular culture, this alleged UFO fleet is referred to as the Nazi flying saucers from Antarctica.\n\n\n=== Richard Chase ===\nAccording to a 1979 interview conducted by FBI agent Robert Ressler, imprisoned serial killer Richard Chase believed or claimed to believe due to his schizophrenia that Nazi UFOs had extorted him into committing his murders under threat to his own life. Chase further claimed that prison officials in league with the Nazis were poisoning his food, and he asked Ressler to provide him with a radar gun, with which he could apprehend his enemies. On December 26, 1980, Chase was found dead in his cell. An autopsy found that he committed suicide with an overdose of prescribed antidepressants that he had saved over several weeks.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nIn 1947, Robert A. Heinlein published Rocket Ship Galileo, a science fiction novel featuring a German moon base.\nIron Sky (2012): a science fiction black comedy about Nazis who left Earth from their hidden base in Antarctica and established a secret fortress on the dark side of the Moon. After Germany\'s defeat in 1945, the Nazis vowed to return to Earth \"in peace,\" and they finally return in the year 2018, but with a full invasion force of flying saucers in order to finally defeat the Allies and restore Nazi Germany. During their invasion, they end up battling with the President of the United States (who in the film resembles Sarah Palin) and unintentionally cause a worldwide nuclear war when every space-faring nation on Earth lays claim to the Nazis\' powerful Helium-3 resources on the Moon.\nIron Sky: Invasion (2012): a video game space combat simulator and an expansion of the 2012 movie, with interactive and flyable recreations of numerous alleged prototypes and models of Nazi UFO spacecraft.\nIron Sky: The Coming Race is an upcoming Finnish-German comic science fiction action film directed by Timo Vuorensola, a sequel to Vuorensola\'s earlier Iron Sky. The film is currently being crowdfunded through Indiegogo and is aiming for a 2018 release. A major inspiration of the content (and the title) appears to be the Vril Society.\nRobert Rankin\'s novel Nostradamus Ate My Hamster features Hitler and a group of Nazis escaping the end of the war to the future in a time machine; they attempt the subtle takeover of Earth through media manipulation until their time machine is used against them.\nFrancisco Ortega\'s novel El Verbo Kaifman (Kaifman Verb) (2014), describes a Nazi Haunebu UFO found by the main character, Paul Kaifman. The craft is described as a copy of a Vimana and is later used by Paul to travel through time.\nThe History Channel program Ancient Aliens has featured episodes about Nazi UFOs and Nazi UFO conspiracy theories.\nUnsealed Alien Files claims that Nazi technological advances came from alien technology stolen from a crashed UFO and the possibility of their own UFOs.\nIn Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus UFOs are used by the Nazi regime as a form of space travel, and the resistance successfully manages to steal one of them when they sent Blazkowicz to Venus.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAhnenerbe\nCircular wing\nDie Glocke\nEsoteric Nazism\nFoo fighter\nGhost rockets\nLandig Group\nList of reported UFO sightings\nNazi occultism\nOperation Highjump\nSpace Nazis\nUFO conspiracy theory\nUrda (anime)\nVaimanika Shastra\nTrotskyist Ufology\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nChester, Keith (2007), Strange Company: Military Encounters with UFOs in WWII, Anomalist, ISBN 978-1-933665-20-7.\nCook, Nick (2003), The Hunt for Zero Point, New York: Broadway.\nFarrell, Joseph P, Reich of the Black Sun: Nazi Secret Weapons and the Cold War Allied Legend.\nGodwin, Joscelyn (1996), Arktos: The Polar Myth in Science, Symbolism, and Nazi Survival, Adventures Unlimited, ISBN 0-932813-35-6.\nLyne, William R (2007) [1993], Pentagon Aliens (3rd ed.), Creatopia, ISBN 978-0-9637467-7-1, 306 pp.\nPartridge, Christopher (2002), UFO Religions, Routledge, ISBN 0-415-26324-7.\nRatthofer, Norbert Jürgen; Ettl, Ralf (1988/90), UFO – Das Dritte Reich schlägt zurück?

(143, 'Harbour Mille incident', 'Below is a partial list of alleged sightings of unidentified flying objects or UFOs in Canada.\n\n\n== 1960, Clan Lake, Northwest Territories ==\nOn June 18, 1960, a prospector told the Yellowknife RCMP detachment that a month earlier, he and his partner saw a UFO at Clan Lake, located 30 miles north of Yellowknife. According to UFOlogist Chris Rutkowski, the men claimed they saw a hovering object 4 to 6 feet wide that hit the surface of the lake. The RCMP investigated, but found nothing.\n\n\n== 1967, Falcon Lake, Manitoba incident ==\nStefan Michalak claimed he was burned by one of two flying saucers with which he reportedly came into contact on May 19, 1967 near Falcon Lake (Manitoba). Ufologists claim that images of Michalak in the hospital show a grid of burn marks on his chest, and a similar grid appears burned into his t-shirt. Ufologists consider it to be one of the most documented UFO stories in Canada.Two books have been written on the alleged Falcon Lake occurrence:\n\n(2017). Stan Michalak, Chris Rutkowski. When They Appeared Falcon Lake 1967: The inside story of a close encounter. ISBN 9781772800951\n(2015). George Dudding. The Falcon Lake UFO Encounter. ISBN 978-1514246825Skeptic Dr. Aaron Sakulich reviewed the report made by Michalak to police shortly after the incident, along with other evidence, and concluded that Michalak was indeed burned but that the burns were in fact likely caused by an accident brought on by alcohol consumption, and that Michalak, who was prospecting for silver ore near the lake at the time, probably made the story up to keep other prospectors out of the area.In April 2018, the Royal Canadian Mint released a $20 silver coin depicting the alleged event as part of its Canada\'s Unexplained Phenomena series, stating \"According to Stefan Michalak’s account, two glowing objects descended from the sky on May 20, 1967, near Falcon Lake, Manitoba, where one landed close enough for him to approach. When the craft suddenly took flight, its emission set Michalak’s clothes ablaze, leaving him with mysterious burns… and an unusual tale to tell.\"\n\n\n== 1967, Shag Harbour, Nova Scotia incident ==\n\nThe incident was the purported crash of an Unidentified Flying Object in Shag Harbour, Nova Scotia in October 1967.\n\n\n== 1969, Prince George, B.C. UFO ==\nIn Prince George, British Columbia, three unrelated witnesses reported a strange, round object in the late afternoon sky on January 1, 1969. The sphere radiated a yellow-orange light and appeared to ascend from 2,000 to 10,000 feet.\n\n\n== 1975-1976, Southern Manitoba ==\nSeveral sightings were reported of a red glowing UFO, sometimes described as \"mischievous\" or \"playful\", sighted in Southern Manitoba in 1975 and 1976.\n\n\n== 1978, Clarenville, Newfoundland and Labrador ==\nIn October 1978, Constable Jim Blackwood of the RCMP witnessed a sighting of a flying saucer hovering over the harbour near the town of Clarenville and Random Island.  This was reported to him by local citizens.  When he arrived at the scene the UFO was still present and quite visible. He had a special high powered viewing scope which happened to be on loan at the time for other surveillance.  The craft stayed in the area for approximately an hour and a half.  When he switched on the roof lights of his police cruiser the craft appeared to mimic the flashing lights.  This made headline news at the time and was broadcast on CBC television and NTV broadcasting in Newfoundland.  The craft took off like a shooting star high in the sky and disappeared. Two years after the incident the BBC did a documentary on UFO sightings and included the Clarenville sighting in their broadcast.  In later years Cst Blackwood retired to his native home in Stellarton, Nova Scotia.\n\n\n== 1986, Munros Point, Nova Scotia Sighting ==\nIn the early evening of January 20, 1986 a couple travelling by car on a rural road in Cape Breton, NS witnessed a bright light appear and hover directly over their car. Almost immediately their vehicle lost power. After watching the blinding light for less than a minute, they watched it quickly accelerate away from them, lighting up the ground below the object as it departed.\n\n\n== 1989, Marieville, Quebec ==\nOn November 20 at 5.30 p.m., in Sainte-Marie-de-Monnoir (a rural neighbourhood of Marieville) several people heard a noise similar to an electric generator and saw some strange lights in the sky. Two days after the phenomenon a perfect round circle was found outside the residence of Mr Jean Prigent, one of the witnesses of the sighting.\n\n\n== 1990, Montreal aerial phenomenon ==\nOn November 7, 1990, in Montreal, Quebec, witnesses reported a round, metallic object of about 540 metres wide over the rooftop pool of the Bonaventure Hotel. Eyewitnesses saw 8 to 10 lights forming into a circle above them, emitting bright white rays. The phenomenon lasted three hours, from 7 to 10 p.m., and moved slowly northwards. While none could identify the lights, a few witnesses, according to the next day’s report in La Presse, were ready to express their belief that they were visited by aliens.A few witnesses say what they saw in a televised interview on CBC.\n\n\n== 2006, Ajax, Ontario ==\nA UFO was photographed in Ajax, Ontario.\n\n\n== 2010, Harbour Mille incident ==\nDuring the night of January 25, 2010 there were multiple UFO sighting reports in Harbour Mille, Newfoundland and Labrador. Royal Canadian Mounted Police initially stated the reports were due to a missile launch, but later retracted the statement, and the Office of the Prime Minister stated that the UFOS were not missiles. Another minor report of this incident came from Calgary where boys playing hockey reported seeing similar objects, about which they stated \"We thought they were Transformers\"\n\n\n== 2014, Kensington, PEI Sighting ==\nWhile putting out a bonfire late in the evening of June 4, 2014, John Sheppard witnessed unusual lights in the sky over the Gulf of St. Lawrence and captured 22 minutes of it on his cellphone. After reporting the incident to MUFON and their investigation concluding it being a confirmed sighting, CBC covered the event. The next day, CBC released a follow-up article in which a series of alternate explanations for the event were presented.\n\n\n== 2014, Multiple reports of UFO sightings over Toronto, Ontario ==\nThere were multiple reports of a UFO activity above Toronto in the last week of July 2014.\n\n\n== Canadian UFO survey results ==\nAccording to the 2002 Canadian UFO Survey published by Ufology Research of Manitoba, Toronto had the largest number of sightings with 34, followed by Vancouver with 31 and Terrace, B.C. with 25 reports. In 2002, a typical UFO sighting lasted approximately 15 minutes.\nThe Canadian Federal Government currently (2007) directs all UFO sightings to Chris Rutkowski of Ufology Research of Manitoba.On July 15, 2018, a Canadian news site mentioned a new study conducted by Ufology Research, formerly known as Ufology Research of Manitoba, stating there have been more than 1,000 UFO sightings reported in Canada in 2017.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Latest UFO Sightings in Canada (latest-ufos.com)\nThe Latest UFO Sightings (ufosightings.ca)\nMUFON - Last 20 Sightings Reports\nAlberta UFO Research Group (AUFORG)\nAlberta UFO Study Group (AUFOSG)\nAssociation Québécoise d\'Ufologie (AQU)\nCanadian Crop Circle Research Network\nCanadian UFO Report - The Canadian UFO Survey\nCanada\'s Unidentified Flying Objects: The Search for the Unknown, a virtual museum exhibition at Library and Archives Canada\nCanadian X-Files - Comprehensive UFO Research Site, Joe Daniels - Extensive amount of government documents at this site.\nHBCC Research - HBCCUFO - British Columbia\nORBWATCH, Info.

(145, 'Jimmy Carter UFO incident', 'Jimmy Carter (US President 1977–1981) reported seeing an unidentified flying object while at Leary, Georgia, in 1969.\nWhile serving as Governor of Georgia, Carter was asked to file a report of the sighting by the International UFO Bureau in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, which he did in September 1973. Since its writing, the report has been discussed several times by both ufologists and by members of the mainstream media.\n\n\n== Sighting ==\nOne evening in 1969, two years before he became governor of Georgia, Carter was preparing to give a speech at a Lions Club meeting. At about 7:15 pm (EST), one of the guests called his attention to a strange object that was visible about 30 degrees above the horizon to the west of where he was standing. Carter described the object as being bright white and as being about as bright as the moon. It was said to have appeared to have closed in on where he was standing but to have stopped beyond a stand of pine trees some distance from him. The object is then said to have changed color, first to blue, then to red, then back to white, before appearing to recede into the distance.\nCarter felt that the object was self-illuminated, and not solid in nature. Carter\'s report indicates that it was witnessed by about ten or twelve other people, and was in view for ten to twelve minutes before it passed out of sight.In 1973 Carter said (Sheaffer 1998:20–21)\n\nThere were about twenty of us standing outside of a little restaurant, I believe, a high school lunch room, and a kind of green light appeared in the western sky.  This was right after sundown.  It got brighter and brighter.  And then it eventually disappeared.  It didn\'t have any solid substance to it, it was just a very peculiar-looking light. None of us could understand what it was.\nSpeaking in a 2005 interview, Carter states: \n\nAll of a sudden, one of the men looked up and said, \'Look, over in the west!\' And there was a bright light in the sky. We all saw it. And then the light, it got closer and closer to us. And then it stopped, I don\'t know how far away, but it stopped beyond the pine trees. And all of a sudden it changed color to blue, and then it changed to red, then back to white. And we were trying to figure out what in the world it could be, and then it receded into the distance.\n\n\n=== Date ===\nThe exact date on which the sighting occurred has been called into question by investigators. According to the report that he filed with the International UFO Bureau four years after the incident, Carter saw the UFO in October 1969. However investigators have cited Lions Club records as evidence that it occurred nine months earlier (Sheaffer 1998:18–28).\nAccording to a meeting report that he filed with the Lions Club, Carter gave his Leary speech on January 6, 1969, not in October. The setting of his January meeting as described in his report to the Lions Club also matches the setting that he would later describe to the media when speaking about his sighting.  His report to the Lions Club made no mention of the sighting itself.(Sheaffer 1998:18–28)\nOther evidence uncovered rules out the October 1969 date and is consistent with January 1969. First, Carter visited the Leary Lions Club in his capacity as district governor of the Lions Club.  His term ended in June 1969. Second, the Leary Lions Club disbanded several months before October 1969 (Sheaffer 1998:18–28).\n\n\n== Object and investigation ==\nAccording to an investigation carried out in 1976, some seven years after the event, most of those present at the meeting either did not recall the event, or did not recall it as being anything important. According to Fred Hart, the only guest contacted who remembered seeing the object: \"It seems like there was a little—like a blue light or something or other in the sky that night—like some kind of weather balloon they send out or something ... it had been pretty far back in my mind.\"(Sheaffer 1998:21–22).\nWhile puzzled by the object and its origins Carter, himself, later said that while he had considered the object to be a UFO—on the grounds it was unexplained—his knowledge of physics had meant he had not believed himself to be witnessing an alien spacecraft.On January 6, 1969, the sky was clear in Leary and the planet Venus was near its maximum brightness and in the direction described by Carter.  Ufologist Robert Sheaffer concluded that the object that Carter witnessed was a misidentification of Venus (Peebles 1994:205). Ufologist Allan Hendry did calculations and agrees with the assessment of it being Venus. (Miles 2006:50–52)  This could also be the Venus \"Halo\" [1], as was discussed on The Skeptics\' Guide to the Universe podcast #105 in a 2007 interview with Jimmy Carter.   In the interview Carter stated that he did not believe the object was Venus, explaining that he was an amateur astronomer and knew what Venus looked like. He also said that as a scientist he did not believe it was an alien craft and at the time assumed it was probably a military aircraft from a nearby base. However, he said that the object did not make any sound like a helicopter would do. Carter also said that he did not believe that any extraterrestrials have visited Earth. He also stated he knows of no government cover-up of extraterrestrial visits and that the rumors that the CIA refused to give him information about UFOs are not true.In a 2016 follow up episode of The Skeptics\' Guide to the Universe podcast #561 a letter forwarded from a member of the Carter family from Carl G. \'Jere\' Justus was read giving his explanation of Carter\'s UFO sighting:\n\nAfter recently reading the book \'Georgia Myths & Legends\', by Augusta Chronicle columnist Don Rhodes, specifically Chapter 5 \'Jimmy Carter and the UFO\', I am virtually certain that I have identified the source of what it was that President Carter saw. In the 1960s and early 70s I worked on an Air Force sponsored project that studied the upper atmosphere using releases of glowing chemical clouds, produced by rockets launched from Eglin AFB rocket range in Florida.  Some of these chemical clouds, notably sodium and barium, were visible by the process of resonance scattering of sunlight.  Clouds of this type had to be launched not long after sunset or not long before sunrise.  This was due to the fact that the cloud had to be in sunlight at high altitude, while it  was still dark enough at ground level for the cloud to be visible against the dark sky. In Carter\'s official 1973 UFO report, as given in the Rhodes book, he stated that he had seen the phenomenon in October, 1969, at 7:15 pm EST.  However, it has been determined from Lions Club records that Carter must have seen the \'UFO\' when he spoke to their Leary, GA Chapter on January 6, 1969.  The report \'U.S. Space Science Program Report to COSPAR, 1970\' (QB504.U54, Appendix I, page 154), documents that there was a barium cloud launched from Eglin AFB (Rocket Number AG7.626) and released on January 6, 1969 at 7:35 pm EST (January 7, 1969, 0035 UTC)  [COSPAR stands for Committee on Space Research].  The reported altitude for this cloud was 152 km.  With a distance between Leary, GA and Eglin AFB, FL of about 234 km, this cloud would have appeared in the sky at an elevation of 33 degrees (consistent with Carter\'s estimate of a 30 degree elevation). Carter\'s report notes that stars were visible, so the night must have been clear.  I can verify from personal experience that under clear skies, a barium cloud such as this would easily have been visible from the distance of Leary, GA. Carter reported the UFO \'appeared from West\'.  The direction of Eglin AFB from Leary, GA is approximately WSW.  Thus this barium cloud at Eglin is consistent with Carter\'s reported \'UFO\' as to time, elevation, AND direction. Furthermore, the appearance reported by Carter is totally consistent with a high altitude barium cloud.  His report stated that it was \'bluish at first, then reddish, luminous not solid\'.  A neutral barium cloud would initially glow bluish or greenish, with parts of it taking on a reddish glow as some the barium becomes ionized in the high altitude sunlight. The size and brightness, reported as being about that of the moon, would also be consistent with a barium cloud at Eglin, as viewed from Leary, GA. Carter has been reported as saying that he never believed that he had seen an alien spacecraft, but that he had no idea exactly what it was. I\'m interested in exploring if this information could be relayed to President Carter, so that if he wishes to, he can better understand what it was that he saw back then.\n\n\n== Personal impact ==\nThe sighting is said to have had a personal impact on Carter and his perception of UFOs and UFO sightings. During his 1976 election campaign, he is said to have told reporters that, as a result of it, he would institute a policy of openness if he were elected to office, saying: \n\nOne thing\'s for sure, I\'ll never make fun of people who say they\'ve seen unidentified objects in the sky. If I become President, I\'ll make every piece of information this country has about UFO sightings available to the public and the scientists.\nDespite his earlier pledge, once elected, Carter distanced himself from disclosure, citing \"defense implications\" as being behind his decision.\n\n\n== 1970s media reports ==\nCarter Once Saw a UFO on \'Very Sober Occasion\', by Howell Raines, Atlanta Constitution, Sept. 14, 1973, p. 1D\nCarter\'s story appeared in the June 8, 1976 issue of The National Enquirer.

According to Johnson, the beam sped towards him, his squad car was engulfed in light, and he heard glass breaking. Johnson said he was unconscious for 39 minutes and when he awoke he realized his wristwatch and the vehicle\'s clock had stopped for 14 minutes. The windshield was shattered, a headlight and red emergency light was damaged and a thin radio aerial bent. Deputies responding to Johnson\'s call for help found the squad car sideways on the road. Johnson suffered bruises and eye irritation that a physician compared to \"welder\'s burns\".\nWhen the story received national publicity, Johnson told reporters the sudden attention had caused him and his family a great deal of emotional strain. On September 11, 1979, Johnson appeared as a guest on ABC\'s Good Morning America program.\n\n\n== In UFOlogy ==\nUFOlogists consider the incident one of the most significant and best-publicized UFO events of the 1970s. Allan Hendry of the Center for UFO Studies investigated the damage to Johnson\'s car along with other aspects of the incident and concluded that Johnson had not hoaxed the event. According to UFOlogist Jerome Clark, Johnson refused to take a polygraph test because he felt that doing so \"would only satisfy people\'s morbid curiosity\". In his 1983 book UFOs: The Public Deceived, UFO skeptic Philip Klass argued that the entire event was a hoax, and that Johnson had deliberately damaged his own patrol car.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of UFO sightings\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nVal Johnson Incident - UFO Casebook\nIntersection of Marshall County Highway 5 and Minnesota State Highway 220 - (street view at the intersection)\nApproximate location of the Val Johnson Incident - (street view)', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1c/Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg'),
(147, 'UFO sightings in Argentina', 'This is an incomplete list of alleged sightings of unidentified flying objects or UFOs in Argentina.\n\n\n== 12 May 1962 ==\nOn 12 May 1962 three truckmen, Valentino Tomassini, Gauro Tomassini and Humberto Zenobi were travelling on Route 35 from Bahia Blanca to Jacinto Aráuz. At 4,10 they saw an object on the ground in a field next to the road at a distance of 100 metres. The object looked like a railroad car and was illuminated. As their truck came close to it, the object rose up and crossed the road at a height of four metres; its lights went out and from the lower part of it came a reddish flame. At last, the object divided into two parts, which flew off in different directions.\n\n\n== 1 December 1965 ==\nThis sighting is called The Adhara Observatory UFO Lunar Transit. It takes place on December 1, 1965 at 8:30 pm, at the private-owner Adhara Observatory in San Miguel, Buenos Aires province. Scientists received several calls concerning strange objects visible on the moon. The staff of the observatory photographed the moon in fixed intervals; after processing, some photos revealed disk shaped objects flying in front of the moon. Some experts think that the UFOs on the photos are probably a fault in the processing of the film.\n\n\n== 27 October 1973 ==\nOn October 30 truck driver Dionisio Llanca was admitted to the Municipal Hospital of Bahía Blanca. He claimed that on the night of October 27, he left his uncle\'s home in Bahia Blanca to travel to Río Gallegos when he stopped to change a tire and became paralyzed by an intense light. According to Llanca, he saw an object in the sky and beings he described as two men and a woman who subjected him to some form of medical testing. Llanca says he briefly awoke hours later approximately 9 kilometers away.

(148, 'Levelland UFO case', 'The Levelland UFO case occurred on November 2–3, 1957, in and around the small town of Levelland, Texas. Levelland, which in 1957 had a population of about 10,000, is located west of Lubbock on the flat prairie of the Texas South Plains. The case is considered by ufologists to be one of the most impressive in UFO history, mainly because of the large number of witnesses involved over a relatively short period of time. However, both the US Air Force and UFO skeptics have described the incident as being caused by either ball lightning or a severe electrical storm.\n\n\n== Reports ==\nOn the evening of November 2, 1957, two immigrant farm workers, Pedro Saucedo and Joe Salaz, called the Levelland police department to report a UFO sighting. Saucedo told police officer A.J. Fowler, who was working the night desk at the police station, that they had been driving four miles (6 km) west of Levelland when they saw a blue flash of light near the road. They claimed their truck\'s engine died, and a rocket-shaped object rose up and approached the truck. According to Saucedo, \"I jumped out of the truck and hit the dirt because I was afraid. I called to Joe but he didn\'t get out. The thing passed directly over my truck with a great sound and rush of wind. It sounded like thunder and my truck rocked from the flash...I felt a lot of heat.\" As the object moved away the truck\'s engine restarted and worked normally. Believing the story to be a joke, Fowler ignored it. An hour later, motorist Jim Wheeler reported a \"brilliantly lit, egg-shaped object, about 200 feet long\" was sitting in the road, four miles (6 km) east of Levelland, blocking his path. He claimed his vehicle died and as he got out of his car the object took off and its lights went out. As it moved away, Wheeler\'s car restarted and worked normally.At 10:55 pm a married couple driving northeast of Levelland reported that they saw a bright flash of light moving across the sky and their headlights and radio died for three seconds. Five minutes later Jose Alvarez claimed he met a strange object sitting on the road 11 miles (18 km) north of Levelland, and his vehicle\'s engine died until the object departed. At 12:05 am (November 3), a Texas Technological College (now Texas Tech University) student named Newell Wright was surprised when, driving 10 miles (16 km) east of Levelland, his \"car engine began to sputter, the ammeter on the dash jumped to discharge and then back to normal, and the motor started cutting out like it was out of gas...the car rolled to a stop; then the headlights dimmed and several seconds later went out.\" When he got out to check on the problem, he saw a \"100-foot-long\" egg-shaped object sitting in the road. It took off, and his engine started running again. At 12:15 am Officer Fowler received another call, this time from a farmer named Frank Williams who claimed he had encountered a brightly glowing object sitting in the road, and \"as his car approached it, its lights went out and its motor stopped.\" The object flew away, and his car\'s lights and motor started working again. Other callers were Ronald Martin at 12:45 am and James Long at 1:15 am, and they both reported seeing a brightly lit object sitting in the road in front of them, and they also claimed that their engines and headlights died until the object flew away.By this time, several Levelland police officers were investigating the reports. Among them was Sheriff Weir Clem, who saw a brilliant red object moving across the sky at 1:30 am. At 1:45 am Levelland\'s Fire Chief, Ray Jones, also saw an object and his vehicle\'s lights and engine sputtered. The reports apparently ended soon after. During the night of November 2–3, the Levelland police department received a total of 15 UFO-related reports, and Officer Fowler noted that \"everybody who called was very excited.\"\n\n\n== U.S. Air Force investigation ==\nThe Levelland sightings received national publicity, and were soon investigated by Project Blue Book. Started in 1947 as Project Sign, Project Blue Book was the official US Air Force research group assigned to investigate UFO reports. An Air Force sergeant was sent to Levelland, and spent seven hours in the city investigating the incident. After interviewing three of the eyewitnesses – Saucedo, Wheeler, and Wright – and after learning that thunderstorms were present in the area earlier in the day, the Air Force investigator concluded that a severe electrical storm – most probably ball lightning or St. Elmo\'s fire – was the major cause for the sightings and reported auto failures. According to UFO historian Curtis Peebles, \"the Air Force found only three persons who had witnessed the \'blue light\'...there was no uniform description of the object.\" Additionally, Project Blue Book believed that \"Saucedo\'s account could not be relied upon – he had only a grade school education and had no concept of direction and was conflicting in his answers...in view of the stormy weather conditions, an electrical phenomenon such as ball lightning or St. Elmo\'s fire seemed to be the most probable cause.\" The engine failures mentioned by the eyewitnesses were blamed on \"wet electrical circuits.\" Donald H. Menzel, an astronomer at Harvard University and a prominent UFO skeptic, agreed with the Air Force explanation: \"members of civilian saucer groups complained that, since [the Air Force investigator] had spent only seven hours in the area, he had obviously not taken the problem seriously and could not have found the correct solution. Even seventy hours of labor, however, could not have produced a clearer picture...the evidence leads to an overwhelming probability: the fiery unknown at Levelland was ball lightning.\" Menzel argued that \"in Levelland on the night of November 2 conditions were ideal for the formation of ball lightning. For several days the area had been experiencing freak weather, and on the night in question had been visited by rain, thunderstorms and lightning.\" Menzel admitted that \"since ball lightning is short-lived and cannot be preserved as tangible evidence, its appearance on the night of November 2 can never be absolutely proved.\" However, he also argued that \"only the saucer proponents could have converted so trivial a series of events – a few stalled automobiles, balls of flame in the sky at the end of the thunderstorm – into a national mystery.\"\n\n\n== Ufologists ==\nTwo prominent ufologists – James E. McDonald and J. Allen Hynek – disputed the Air Force ball lightning/electrical storm explanation. Both men argued that there was no electrical storm in the area when the sightings occurred. In testimony before a committee of the US House of Representatives in 1968, McDonald said that \"One famous [UFO] case was at Levelland, Texas...ten vehicles were stopped within a short area, all independently in a 2-hour period. There was no lightning or thunder storm, and only a trace of rain.\" Hynek wrote that \"as the person responsible for the tracking of the new Soviet satellite Sputnik, I was on a virtual around-the-clock duty and was unable to give it any attention whatever. I am not proud today that I hastily concurred in [the Air Force\'s] evaluation as \'ball lightning\' on the basis of information that an electrical storm had been in progress in the Levelland area at the time. This was shown not to be the case. Observers reported overcast and mist but no lightning.\" Hynek also noted that \"had I given it any thought whatsoever, I would soon have recognized the absence of any evidence that ball lightning can stop cars and put out headlights.\" Ufologists have also argued that the Air Force investigator did not interview nine of the fifteen witnesses, nor were they mentioned in Blue Book\'s final report on the incident.\n\n\n== Media coverage ==\nIn March 2002, Dallas-based television station KDFW aired a report about the Levelland UFO case in which reporter Richard Ray interviewed Sheriff Weir Clem\'s widow and friends.\n\n\n== See also ==\nLubbock Lights\nList of UFO sightings\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nClark, Jerome.

(149, 'Roswell UFO incident', 'In mid-1947, a United States Army Air Forces balloon crashed at a ranch near Roswell, New Mexico. Following wide initial interest in the crashed \"flying disc\", the US military stated that it was merely a conventional weather balloon. Interest subsequently waned until the late 1970s, when ufologists began promoting a variety of increasingly elaborate conspiracy theories, claiming that one or more alien spacecraft had crash-landed and that the extraterrestrial occupants had been recovered by the military, which then engaged in a cover-up.\nIn the 1990s, the US military published two reports disclosing the true nature of the crashed object: a nuclear test surveillance balloon from Project Mogul. Nevertheless, the Roswell incident continues to be of interest in popular media, and conspiracy theories surrounding the event persist. Roswell has been described as \"the world\'s most famous, most exhaustively investigated, and most thoroughly debunked UFO claim\".\n\n\n== Events of 1947 ==\n\nThe sequence of events was triggered by the crash of a Project Mogul balloon near Roswell.On June 14, 1947, William Brazel, a foreman working on the Foster homestead, noticed clusters of debris approximately 30 miles (50 km) north of Roswell, New Mexico. This date—or \"about three weeks\" before July 8—appeared in later stories featuring Brazel, but the initial press release from the Roswell Army Air Field (RAAF) said the find was \"sometime last week\", suggesting Brazel found the debris in early July. Brazel told the Roswell Daily Record that he and his son saw a \"large area of bright wreckage made up of rubber strips, tinfoil, a rather tough paper and sticks.\" He paid little attention to it but returned on July 4 with his son, wife and daughter to gather up the material. Some accounts have described Brazel as having gathered some of the material earlier, rolling it together and stashing it under some brush. The next day, Brazel heard reports about \"flying discs\" and wondered if that was what he had picked up. On July 7, Brazel saw Sheriff Wilcox and \"whispered kinda confidential like\" that he may have found a flying disc. Another account quotes Wilcox as saying Brazel reported the object on July 6.Wilcox called RAAF Major Jesse Marcel and a \"man in plainclothes\" accompanied Brazel back to the ranch where more pieces were picked up. \"[We] spent a couple of hours Monday afternoon [July 7] looking for any more parts of the weather device\", said Marcel. \"We found a few more patches of tinfoil and rubber.\"On July 8, 1947, Roswell Army Air Field (RAAF) public information officer Walter Haut issued a press release stating that personnel from the field\'s 509th Operations Group had recovered a \"flying disc\", which had crashed on a ranch near Roswell. As described in the July 9, 1947 edition of the Roswell Daily Record,\n\nThe balloon which held it up, if that was how it worked, must have been 12 feet [3.5 m] long, [Brazel] felt, measuring the distance by the size of the room in which he sat. The rubber was smoky gray in color and scattered over an area about 200 yards [180 m] in diameter. When the debris was gathered up, the tinfoil, paper, tape, and sticks made a bundle about three feet [1 m] long and 7 or 8 inches [18 or 20 cm] thick, while the rubber made a bundle about 18 or 20 inches [45 or 50 cm] long and about 8 inches [20 cm] thick. In all, he estimated, the entire lot would have weighed maybe five pounds [2 kg]. There was no sign of any metal in the area which might have been used for an engine, and no sign of any propellers of any kind, although at least one paper fin had been glued onto some of the tinfoil. There were no words to be found anywhere on the instrument, although there were letters on some of the parts. Considerable Scotch tape and some tape with flowers printed upon it had been used in the construction. No strings or wires were to be found but there were some eyelets in the paper to indicate that some sort of attachment may have been used.\nA telex sent to a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) office from the Fort Worth, Texas office quoted a Major from the Eighth Air Force (also based in Fort Worth at Carswell Air Force Base) on July 8, 1947 as saying that \"The disc is hexagonal in shape and was suspended from a ballon [sic] by cable, which ballon [sic] was approximately twenty feet (6 m) in diameter. Major Curtan further advices advises [sic] that the object found resembles a high altitude weather balloon with a radar reflector, but that telephonic conversation between their office and Wright field had not [UNINTELLIGIBLE] borne out this belief.\"\n\nEarly on Tuesday, July 8, the RAAF issued a press release, which was immediately picked up by numerous news outlets:\nThe many rumors regarding the flying disc became a reality yesterday when the intelligence office of the 509th Bomb group of the Eighth Air Force, Roswell Army Air Field, was fortunate enough to gain possession of a disc through the cooperation of one of the local ranchers and the sheriff\'s office of Chaves County. The flying object landed on a ranch near Roswell sometime last week. Not having phone facilities, the rancher stored the disc until such time as he was able to contact the sheriff\'s office, who in turn notified Maj. Jesse A. Marcel of the 509th Bomb Group Intelligence Office. Action was immediately taken and the disc was picked up at the rancher\'s home. It was inspected at the Roswell Army Air Field and subsequently loaned by Major Marcel to higher headquarters.\nColonel William H. Blanchard, commanding officer of the 509th, contacted General Roger M. Ramey of the Eighth Air Force in Fort Worth, Texas, and Ramey ordered the object be flown to Fort Worth Army Air Field. At the base, Warrant Officer Irving Newton confirmed Ramey\'s preliminary opinion, identifying the object as being a weather balloon and its \"kite\", a nickname for a radar reflector used to track the balloons from the ground. Another news release was issued, this time from the Fort Worth base, describing the object as being a \"weather balloon\".\nThe military decided to conceal the true purpose of the crashed device – nuclear test monitoring – and instead inform the public that the crash was of a weather balloon. Later that day, the press reported that Commanding General of the Eighth Air Force Roger Ramey had stated that a weather balloon was recovered by the RAAF personnel. A press conference was held, featuring debris (foil, rubber and wood) said to be from the crashed object, which matched the weather balloon description. Historian Robert Goldberg wrote that the intended effect was achieved: \"the story died the next day\".Subsequently, the incident faded from the attention of UFO enthusiasts for more than 30 years.\n\n\n== Growing interest, 1978–1994 ==\nBetween 1978 and the early 1990s, UFO researchers such as Stanton T. Friedman, William Moore, Karl T. Pflock, and the team of Kevin D. Randle and Donald R. Schmitt interviewed several hundred people who claimed to have had a connection with the events at Roswell in 1947. Hundreds of documents were obtained via Freedom of Information Act requests, along with other documents such as Majestic 12 that were supposedly leaked by insiders. Their conclusions were at least one alien spacecraft crashed near Roswell, alien bodies had been recovered, and a government cover-up of the incident had taken place.Over the years, books, articles, and television specials brought the 1947 incident significant notoriety. By the mid-1990s, public polls such as a 1997 CNN/Time poll, revealed that the majority of people interviewed believed that aliens had indeed visited Earth, and that aliens had landed at Roswell, but that all the relevant information was being kept secret by the US government.According to anthropologists Susan Harding and Kathleen Stewart, the Roswell Story was the prime example of how a discourse moved from the fringes to the mainstream according to the prevailing zeitgeist: public preoccupation in the 1980s with \"conspiracy, cover-up and repression\" aligned well with the Roswell narratives as told in the \"sensational books\" which were being published.\n\n\n=== Friedman\'s initial work ===\nIn 1978, nuclear physicist and author Stanton T. Friedman interviewed Jesse Marcel, the only person known to have accompanied the Roswell debris from where it was recovered to Fort Worth where reporters saw material which was claimed to be part of the recovered object. The accounts given by Friedman and others in the following years elevated Roswell from a forgotten incident to perhaps the most famous UFO case of all time.\n\n\n=== Books ===\n\n\n==== The Roswell Incident (1980) ====\nThe first conspiracy book about Roswell was The Roswell Incident (1980) by Charles Berlitz and William Moore, authors who had previously written popular books on the Philadelphia Experiment and on the Bermuda Triangle.Historian Kathy Olmsted writes that the material in this book has come to be known as \"version 1\" of the Roswell myth. Berlitz and Moore\'s narrative holds that an alien craft was flying over the New Mexico desert observing US nuclear weapons activity, but crashed after being hit by lightning, killing the aliens on board; a government cover-up duly followed.The authors claimed to have interviewed over ninety witnesses. Though he was uncredited, Friedman carried out some research for the book. The Roswell Incident featured accounts of debris described by Marcel as \"nothing made on this earth.\" Additional accounts by Bill Brazel, son of Mac Brazel, neighbor Floyd Proctor and Walt Whitman Jr., son of newsman W. E. Whitman who had interviewed Mac Brazel, suggested the material Marcel recovered had super-strength not associated with a weather balloon. The book introduced the contention that debris which was recovered by Marcel at the Foster ranch, visible in photographs showing Marcel posing with the debris, was substituted for debris from a weather device as part of a cover-up. The book also claimed that the debris recovered from the ranch was not permitted a close inspection by the press. The efforts by the military were described as being intended to discredit and \"counteract the growing hysteria towards flying saucers\". Two accounts of witness intimidation were included in the book, including the incarceration of Mac Brazel. The book also introduced the secondhand stories of civil engineer Barney Barnett and a group of archeology students from an unidentified university seeing alien wreckage and bodies while in the desert.Berlitz and Moore\'s narrative was dominant until the late 1980s when other authors, attracted by the commercial potential of writing about Roswell, started producing rival accounts.\n\n\n==== UFO Crash at Roswell (1991) ====\nIn 1991, Kevin Randle and Donald Schmitt published UFO Crash at Roswell. They added 100 new witnesses, altered and tightened the narrative, and included several \"sinister\" new twists.Some new details were included, including accounts of a \"gouge ... that extended four or five hundred feet [120 or 150 m]\" at the ranch and descriptions of an elaborate cordon and recovery operation. Several witnesses in The Roswell Incident described being turned back from the Foster ranch by armed military police, but extensive descriptions were not given. The Barnett accounts were mentioned, though the dates and locations were changed from the accounts found in The Roswell Incident. In the new account, Brazel was described as leading the Army to a second crash site on the ranch, at which point the Army personnel were supposedly \"horrified to find civilians [including Barnett] there already.\"Glenn Dennis was produced as a supposedly important witness in 1989, after calling the hotline when an episode of Unsolved Mysteries featured the Roswell incident. His descriptions of Roswell alien autopsies were the first account that said there were alien corpses at the Roswell Army Air Base.Randle and Schmitt\'s book sold 160,000 copies.\n\n\n==== Crash at Corona (1992) ====\nIn 1992, Stanton Friedman re-entered the scene with his own book Crash at Corona, co-authored with Don Berliner – an author of books on space and aviation. Goldberg writes that Friedman too introduced new \"witnesses\", and that he added to the narrative by doubling the number of flying saucers to two, and the number of aliens to eight – two of which were said to have survived and been taken into custody by the government.\n\n\n==== The Truth about the UFO Crash at Roswell (1994) ====\nRandle and Schmitt responded with another book, updating their previous narrative with several new details, including the claim that alien bodies were taken by cargo plane to be viewed by Dwight D. Eisenhower, who was curious about their appearance.\n\n\n==== The Day After Roswell (1997) ====\nFormer Lt. Col. Philip J. Corso reported in his autobiographical book that the Roswell Crash did happen and that when he was assigned to Fort Riley (Kansas) in July 1947, 5 trucks of 25 tons and some semi trailers entered the base from Fort Bliss Texas. He claimed while he was patrolling the base he was brought into the medical facilities by Sgt. Brown and shown the remnants of bodies that were from an \"air crash\". Philip Klass analyzed his claims line by line and exposed many inconsistencies and factual errors.\n\n\n=== Competing accounts ===\nThe existence of so many differing accounts by 1994 led to a schism among ufologists about the events at Roswell. The Center for UFO Studies (CUFOS) and the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON), two leading UFO societies, disagreed in their views of the various scenarios presented by Randle–Schmitt and Friedman–Berliner; several conferences were held to try to resolve the differences. One issue under discussion was where Barnett was when he saw the alien craft he was said to have encountered. A 1992 UFO conference had attempted to achieve a consensus among the various scenarios portrayed in Crash at Corona and UFO Crash at Roswell, however, the publication of The Truth About the UFO Crash at Roswell had \"resolved\" the Barnett problem by simply ignoring Barnett and citing a new location for the alien craft recovery, including a new group of archaeologists not connected to the ones the Barnett story cited.Don Schmitt held that variations in narratives between different writers was not however an essential problem, commenting by way of comparison \"We know Jesus Christ was crucified, we just don\'t know where.\"\n\n\n==== Problems with witness accounts ====\nHundreds of people were interviewed by the various researchers, but critics point out that only a few of these people claimed to have seen debris or aliens. Most witnesses were repeating the claims of others, and their testimony would be considered hearsay in an American court of law and therefore inadmissible as evidence. Of the 90 people claimed to have been interviewed for The Roswell Incident, the testimony of only 25 appears in the book, and only seven of these people saw the debris. Of these, five handled the debris. Pflock, in Roswell: Inconvenient Facts and the Will to Believe (2001), makes a similar point about Randle and Schmitt\'s UFO Crash at Roswell. Approximately 271 people are listed in the book who were \"contacted and interviewed\" for the book, and this number does not include those who chose to remain anonymous, meaning more than 300 witnesses were interviewed, a figure Pflock said the authors frequently cited. Of these 300-plus individuals, only 41 can be \"considered genuine first- or second-hand witnesses to the events in and around Roswell or at the Fort Worth Army Air Field,\" and only 23 can be \"reasonably thought to have seen physical evidence, debris recovered from the Foster Ranch.\" Of these, only seven have asserted anything suggestive of otherworldly origins for the debris.As for the accounts from those who claimed to have seen aliens, critics identified problems ranging from the reliability of second-hand accounts, to credibility problems with witnesses making demonstrably false claims, or multiple, contradictory accounts, to dubious death-bed confessions or accounts from elderly and easily confused witnesses. Pflock noted that only four people with supposed firsthand knowledge of alien bodies were interviewed and identified by Roswell authors: Frank Kaufmann; Jim Ragsdale; Lt. Col. Albert Lovejoy Duran; Gerald Anderson. Duran is mentioned in a brief footnote in The Truth About the UFO Crash at Roswell and never again, while the other three all have serious credibility problems. A problem with all the accounts, charge critics, is they all came about a minimum of 31 years after the events in question, and in many cases were recounted more than 40 years after the fact. Not only are memories this old of dubious reliability, they were also subject to contamination from other accounts the interviewees may have been exposed to. The shifting claims of Jesse Marcel, whose suspicion that what he recovered in 1947 was \"not of this world\" sparked interest in the incident in the first place, cast serious doubt on the reliability of what he claimed to be true.\nIn The Roswell Incident, Marcel stated, \"Actually, this material may have looked like tinfoil and balsa wood, but the resemblance ended there ... They took one picture of me on the floor holding up some of the less-interesting metallic debris ... The stuff in that one photo was pieces of the actual stuff we found. It was not a staged photo.\" Timothy Printy points out that the material Marcel positively identified as being part of what he recovered is material that skeptics and UFO advocates agree is debris from a balloon device. After that fact was pointed out to him, Marcel changed his story to say that that material was not what he recovered. Skeptics like Robert Todd argued that Marcel had a history of embellishment and exaggeration, such as claiming to have been a pilot and having received five Air Medals for shooting down enemy planes, claims that were all found to be false, and skeptics feel that his evolving Roswell story was simply another instance of this tendency to fabricate.\n\n\n== Air Force reports, 1994–1997 ==\nIn response to these reports, and after United States congressional inquiries, the General Accounting Office launched an inquiry and directed the Office of the United States Secretary of the Air Force to conduct an internal investigation. The result was summarized in two reports. The first, released in 1994, concluded that the material recovered in 1947 was likely debris from Project Mogul, a military surveillance program employing high-altitude balloons (and classified portion of an unclassified New York University project by atmospheric researchers). The second report, released in 1997, concluded that reports of recovered alien bodies were likely a combination of innocently transformed memories of accidents involving military casualties with memories of the recovery of anthropomorphic dummies in military programs such as the 1950s Operation High Dive, mixed with hoaxes perpetrated by various witnesses and UFO proponents. The psychological effects of time compression and confusion about when events occurred explained the discrepancy with the years in question.The Air Force reports were dismissed by UFO proponents as being either disinformation or simply implausible, though skeptical researchers such as Philip J. Klass and Robert Todd, who had been expressing doubts regarding accounts of aliens for several years, used the reports as the basis for skeptical responses to claims by UFO proponents. After the release of the Air Force reports, several books, such as Kal Korff\'s The Roswell UFO Crash: What They Don\'t Want You To Know (1997), built on the evidence presented in the reports to conclude \"there is no credible evidence that the remains of an extraterrestrial spacecraft was involved.\" In the 1990s, skeptics and even some social anthropologists saw the increasingly elaborate accounts of alien crash landings and government cover ups as evidence of a myth being constructed.\n\n\n== Recent interest ==\n\n\n=== Evidence ===\nAlthough there is no evidence that a UFO crashed at Roswell, believers firmly hold to the belief that one did, and that the truth has been concealed as a result of a government conspiracy. B. D. Gildenberg has called the Roswell incident \"the world\'s most famous, most exhaustively investigated, and most thoroughly debunked UFO claim\".Pflock said, \"[T]he case for Roswell is a classic example of the triumph of quantity over quality. The advocates of the crashed-saucer tale ... simply shovel everything that seems to support their view into the box marked \'Evidence\' and say, \'See? Look at all this stuff. We must be right.\' Never mind the contradictions. Never mind the lack of independent supporting fact. Never mind the blatant absurdities.\" Korff suggests there are clear incentives for some people to promote the idea of aliens at Roswell, and that many researchers were not doing competent work: \"[The] UFO field is comprised of people who are willing to take advantage of the gullibility of others, especially the paying public. Let\'s not pull any punches here: The Roswell UFO myth has been very good business for UFO groups, publishers, for Hollywood, the town of Roswell, the media, and UFOlogy ... [The] number of researchers who employ science and its disciplined methodology is appallingly small.\"B. D. Gildenberg wrote there were as many as 11 reported alien recovery sites and these recoveries bore only a marginal resemblance to the event as initially reported in 1947, or as recounted later by the initial witnesses. Some of these new accounts could have been confused accounts of the several known recoveries of injured and dead servicemen from four military plane crashes that occurred in the area from 1948 to 1950. Other accounts could have been based on memories of recoveries of test dummies, as suggested by the Air Force in their reports. Charles Ziegler argued that the Roswell story has all the hallmarks of a traditional folk narrative. He identified six distinct narratives, and a process of transmission via storytellers with a core story that was created from various witness accounts, and was then shaped and molded by those who carry on the UFO community\'s tradition. Other \"witnesses\" were then sought out to expand the core narrative, with those who give accounts not in line with the core beliefs being repudiated or simply omitted by the \"gatekeepers.\" Others then retold the narrative in its new form. This whole process would repeat over time.\nIn September 2017, UK newspaper The Guardian reported on Kodachrome slides which some had claimed showed a dead space alien. First presented at a BeWitness event in Mexico, organised by Jaime Maussan and attended by almost 7,000 people, days afterwards it was revealed that the slides were in fact of a mummified Native American child discovered in 1896 and which had been on display at the Chapin Mesa Archeological Museum in Mesa Verde, Colorado for many decades.\n\n\n=== Roswellian Syndrome ===\nProminent skeptics Joe Nickell and co-author James McGaha identified a myth-making process, which they called the \"Roswellian Syndrome\". In this syndrome a myth is proposed to have five distinct stages of development: Incident, Debunking, Submergence, Mythologizing, and Reemergence and Media Bandwagon Effect. The authors predicted that the Roswellian Syndrome would \"play out again and again\", in other UFO and conspiracy-theory stories.\n\n\n=== Recriminations among ufologists ===\nGlenn Dennis, who testified that Roswell alien autopsies were carried out at the Roswell base, and that he and others were the subjects of threats, was deemed one of the \"least credible\" Roswell witnesses by Randle in 1998. In Randle and Schmitt\'s 1991 book UFO Crash at Roswell, Dennis\'s story was featured prominently. Randle said Dennis was not credible \"for changing the name of the nurse once we had proved she didn\'t exist.\" Dennis\'s accounts were also doubted by researcher Pflock.Scientific skeptic author Brian Dunning concurs that Dennis cannot be regarded as a reliable witness, considering that he had seemingly waited over forty years before he started recounting a series of unconnected events. Such events, Dunnings argues, were then arbitrarily joined together to form what has become the most popular narrative of the alleged alien crash.Some prominent UFOlogists including Karl T. Pflock, Kent Jeffrey, and William L. Moore have become convinced that there were no aliens or alien space craft involved in the Roswell crash.\n\n\n=== Alien autopsy hoax ===\n\nIn 1995, film footage purporting to show an alien autopsy and claimed to have been taken by a US military official shortly after the Roswell incident was released by Ray Santilli, a London-based video entrepreneur. The footage caused an international sensation when it aired on television networks around the world.In 2006, Santilli admitted that the film was mostly a reconstruction, but continued to claim it was based on genuine footage now lost, and some original frames that had supposedly survived. A fictionalized version of the creation of the footage and its release was retold in the comedy film Alien Autopsy (2006).\n\n\n=== Photo analysis ===\n\nIn an attempt to produce fresh evidence, some researchers used new technology to try to re-analyze photographs of the telegram held by General Ramey during his 1947 press conference. Goldberg writes that the results proved inconclusive: while some claimed they could discern wording like \"victims of the wreck\", others claimed they saw \"turn out to be weather balloons\". Overall, there was no consensus that anything was legible.\n\n\n=== US political interest ===\nOn October 26, 2007, Bill Richardson (who at the time was a candidate for the Democratic Party nomination for U.S. President) was asked about releasing government files on Roswell. Richardson responded that when he was a Congressman, he attempted to get information on behalf of his New Mexico constituents, but was told by both the Department of Defense and Los Alamos Labs that the information was classified. \"That ticked me off,\" he said \"The government doesn\'t tell the truth as much as it should on a lot of issues.\" He promised to work on opening the files if he were elected as President.In October 2002, before airing its Roswell documentary, the Sci-Fi Channel hosted a Washington UFO news conference. John Podesta, President Clinton\'s chief of staff, appeared as a member of the public relations firm hired by Sci-Fi to help get the government to open up documents on the subject. Podesta stated, \"It is time for the government to declassify records that are more than 25 years old and to provide scientists with data that will assist in determining the true nature of the phenomena.\"When asked during a 2015 interview with GQ Magazine about whether he\'d looked up top secret classified information, President Barack Obama replied \"I gotta tell you, it\'s a little disappointing. People always ask me about Roswell and the aliens and UFOs, and it turns out the stuff going on that\'s top secret isn\'t nearly as exciting as you expect. In this day and age, it\'s not as top secret as you\'d think.\"\n\n\n=== Deathbed confessions ===\nAs time wore on, it became harder for Roswell researchers to find new evidence to publish; there was potential though in the prospect of deathbed confessions from those originally involved in 1947. In 2007 Donald Schmitt and Tom Carey published the book Witness to Roswell, which prominently featured a document said to be a sworn affidavit written by Walter Haut, who had written the first Army press release about the Roswell crash in 1947. The document, apparently kept under seal until Haut\'s death in 2005, described how the 1947 crash debris had been discussed by high-ranking staff and how Haut had seen alien bodies. The claims, however, drew an unimpressed response even from ufologists: Dennis Balthaser said that the document was not written by Haut, and that by 2000 Haut\'s mental state was such he could not recall basic details about his past, making the detail contained in the affidavit seem dubious. Physicist and skeptic Dave Thomas commented: \"Is Roswell still the \'best\' UFO incident? If it is, UFO proponents should be very, very worried.\"\n\n\n=== The \"other Roswell\" ===\n\nThe 1948 Aztec, New Mexico, UFO incident was a hoaxed flying saucer crash and subject of the book Behind the Flying Saucers (1950) by Frank Scully. The incident is sometimes referred to as the \"other Roswell\" and parallels have been drawn between the incidents.\n\n\n=== Area 51 (2011) ===\nAmerican journalist Annie Jacobsen\'s Area 51: An Uncensored History of America\'s Top Secret Military Base (2011), based on interviews with scientists and engineers who worked in Area 51, dismisses the alien story. She quotes one unnamed source as claiming that Josef Mengele, a German Schutzstaffel officer and a physician in Auschwitz, was recruited by the Soviet leader Joseph Stalin to produce \"grotesque, child-size aviators\" to be remotely piloted and landed in America in order to cause hysteria similar to Orson Welles\' The War of the Worlds (1938). The aircraft, however, crashed and the incident was hushed up by the Americans. Jacobsen wrote that the bodies found at the crash site were children around 12 years old with large heads and abnormally-shaped, oversized eyes. They were neither aliens nor consenting airmen, but human guinea pigs. The book was criticized for extensive errors by scientists from the Federation of American Scientists.\n\n\n== See also ==\nGrey alien\nKecksburg UFO incident\nList of conspiracy theories\nList of reported UFO sightings\nNazi UFOs\nPlains of San Agustin\nUFO conspiracy theory\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nBooks, articles\n\nBroad, William J (18 September 1994). \"Wreckage in the Desert Was Odd but Not Alien\".

(150, 'Area 51', 'The United States Air Force facility commonly known as Area 51 is a highly classified remote detachment of Edwards Air Force Base, within the Nevada Test and Training Range. According to the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), the correct names for the facility are Homey Airport  (ICAO: KXTA) and Groom Lake, though the name Area 51 was used in a CIA document from the Vietnam War. The facility has also been referred to as Dreamland and Paradise Ranch, among other nicknames. USAF public relations has referred to the facility as \"an operating location near Groom Dry Lake\". The special use airspace around the field is referred to as Restricted Area 4808 North (R-4808N).The base\'s current primary purpose is publicly unknown; however, based on historical evidence, it most likely supports the development and testing of experimental aircraft and weapons systems (black projects). The intense secrecy surrounding the base has made it the frequent subject of conspiracy theories and a central component to unidentified flying object (UFO) folklore. Although the base has never been declared a secret base, all research and occurrences in Area 51 are Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information (TS/SCI). On 25 June 2013, following a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request filed in 2005, the CIA publicly acknowledged the existence of the base for the first time, declassifying documents detailing the history and purpose of Area 51.Area 51 is located in the southern portion of Nevada in the western United States, 83 miles (134 km) north-northwest of Las Vegas. Situated at its center, on the southern shore of Groom Lake, is a large military airfield. The site was acquired by the United States Air Force in 1955, primarily for the flight testing of the Lockheed U-2 aircraft. The area around Area 51, including the small town of Rachel on the \"Extraterrestrial Highway\", is a popular tourist destination.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Area 51 ===\n\nThe original rectangular base of 6 by 10 miles (9.7 by 16.1 km) is now part of the so-called \"Groom box\", a rectangular area measuring 23 by 25 miles (37 by 40 km), of restricted airspace. The area is connected to the internal Nevada Test Site (NTS) road network, with paved roads leading south to Mercury and west to Yucca Flat. Leading northeast from the lake, the wide and well-maintained Groom Lake Road runs through a pass in the Jumbled Hills. The road formerly led to mines in the Groom basin, but has been improved since their closure. Its winding course runs past a security checkpoint, but the restricted area around the base extends further east. After leaving the restricted area, Groom Lake Road descends eastward to the floor of the Tikaboo Valley, passing the dirt-road entrances to several small ranches, before converging with State Route 375, the \"Extraterrestrial Highway\", south of Rachel.\nArea 51 shares a border with the Yucca Flat region of the Nevada Test Site, the location of 739 of the 928 nuclear tests conducted by the United States Department of Energy at NTS. The Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository is 44 miles (71 km) southwest of Groom Lake.\n\n\n=== Groom Lake ===\n\nGroom Lake is a salt flat in Nevada used for runways of the Nellis Bombing Range Test Site airport (KXTA) on the north of the Area 51 USAF military installation. The lake at 4,409 ft (1,344 m) elevation is approximately 3.7 miles (6.0 km) from north to south and 3 miles (4.8 km) from east to west at its widest point. Located within the namesake Groom Lake Valley portion of the Tonopah Basin, the lake is 25 mi (40 km) south of Rachel, Nevada.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe origin of the Area 51 name is unclear. The most accepted comes from a grid numbering system of the area by the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC); while Area 51 is not part of this system, it is adjacent to Area 15. Another explanation is that 51 was used because it was unlikely that the AEC would use the number.\n\n\n=== Groom Lake ===\n\nLead and silver were discovered in the southern part of the Groom Range in 1864, and the English Groome Lead Mines Limited company financed the Conception Mines in the 1870s, giving the district its name (nearby mines included Maria, Willow and White Lake). The interests in Groom were acquired by J. B. Osborne and partners and patented in 1876, and his son acquired the interests in the 1890s. Claims were incorporated as two 1916 companies with mining continuing until 1918 and resuming after World War II until the early 1950s.\n\n\n=== World War II ===\nThe airfield on the Groom Lake site began service in 1942 as Indian Springs Air Force Auxiliary Field, and consisted of two unpaved 5000-foot runways aligned NE/SW, NW/SE 37°16′35″N 115°45′20″W.\n\n\n=== U-2 program ===\n\nThe Groom Lake test facility was established in April 1955 by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) for Project AQUATONE, the development of the Lockheed U-2 strategic reconnaissance aircraft.\nAs part of the project, the director, Richard M. Bissell, Jr., understood that, given the extreme secrecy enveloping the project, the flight test and pilot training programs could not be conducted at Edwards Air Force Base or Lockheed\'s Palmdale facility. A search for a suitable testing site for the U-2 was conducted under the same extreme security as the rest of the project.He notified Lockheed, who sent an inspection team out to Groom Lake. According to Lockheed\'s U-2 designer Kelly Johnson:\n\"We flew over it and within thirty seconds, you knew that was the place ... it was right by a dry lake. Man alive, we looked at that lake, and we all looked at each other. It was another Edwards, so we wheeled around, landed on that lake, taxied up to one end of it. It was a perfect natural landing field ... as smooth as a billiard table without anything being done to it\". Johnson used a compass to lay out the direction of the first runway. The place was called \"Groom Lake\".\n\nThe lakebed made an ideal strip from which they could test aircraft, and the Emigrant Valley\'s mountain ranges and the NTS perimeter, about 100 mi (160 km) north of Las Vegas, protected the test site from visitors. The CIA asked the AEC to acquire the land, designated \"Area 51\" on the map, and add it to the Nevada Test Site.Johnson named the area \"Paradise Ranch\" to encourage workers to move to a place that the CIA\'s official history of the U-2 project would later describe as \"the new facility in the middle of nowhere\"; the name became shortened to \"the Ranch\".  On 4 May 1955, a survey team arrived at Groom Lake and laid out a 5,000-foot (1,500 m), north-south runway on the southwest corner of the lakebed and designated a site for a base support facility. \"The Ranch\", also known as Site II, initially consisted of little more than a few shelters, workshops and trailer homes in which to house its small team. In a little over three months, the base consisted of a single, paved runway, three hangars, a control tower, and rudimentary accommodations for test personnel. The base\'s few amenities included a movie theatre and volleyball court. Additionally, there was a mess hall, several water wells, and fuel storage tanks. By July 1955, CIA, Air Force, and Lockheed personnel began arriving. The Ranch received its first U-2 delivery on 24 July 1955 from Burbank on a C-124 Globemaster II cargo plane, accompanied by Lockheed technicians on a Douglas DC-3. Regular Military Air Transport Service flights were set up between Area 51 and Lockheed\'s Burbank, California offices. To preserve secrecy, personnel flew to Nevada on Monday mornings and returned to California on Friday evenings.\n\n\n=== OXCART program ===\n\nProject OXCART established in August 1959 for \"antiradar studies, aerodynamic structural tests, and engineering designs [and] all later work on the\" Lockheed A-12 included testing at Groom Lake, which before improvements for OXCART had inadequate facilities: buildings for only 150 people, a 5,000 ft (1,500 m) asphalt runway, and limited fuel, hangar, and shop space. Selected for its seclusion and climate, Groom Lake had received a new official name \"Area 51\" when A-12 test facility construction began in September 1960, including a new 8,500 ft (2,600 m) runway to replace the existing runway (completed by 15 November 1960 with \"expansion joints parallel to the direction of aircraft roll\" to limit vibration.)Four years of \"Project 51\" construction began on 1 October 1960 by Reynolds Electrical and Engineering Company (REECo) with double-shift construction schedules. The contractor upgraded base facilities and built a new 10,000 ft (3,000 m) runway (14/32) diagonally across the southwest corner of the lakebed. An Archimedean spiral approximately two miles across was marked on the dry lake so that an A-12 pilot approaching the end of the overrun could abort to the playa instead of plunging the aircraft into the sagebrush. Area 51 pilots called it \"The Hook\". For crosswind landings two unpaved airstrips (runways 9/27 and 03/21) were marked on the dry lakebed.By August 1961, construction of the essential facilities was completed (3 surplus Navy hangars were erected on the base\'s north side—hangars 4, 5, and 6.) A fourth, Hangar 7, was new construction. The original U-2 hangars were converted to maintenance and machine shops. Facilities in the main cantonment area included workshops and buildings for storage and administration, a commissary, control tower, fire station, and housing. The Navy also contributed more than 130 surplus Babbitt duplex housing units for long-term occupancy facilities. Older buildings were repaired, and additional facilities were constructed as necessary. A reservoir pond, surrounded by trees, served as a recreational area one mile north of the base. Other recreational facilities included a gymnasium, movie theatre, and a baseball diamond. A permanent aircraft fuel tank farm was constructed by early 1962 for the special JP-7 fuel required by the A-12. Seven tanks were constructed, with a total capacity of 1,320,000 gallons.\nFor the arrival of OXCART; security was enhanced and the small civilian mine in the Groom basin was closed. In January 1962, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) expanded the restricted airspace in the vicinity of Groom Lake. The lakebed became the center of a 600-square-mile addition to restricted area R-4808N.The CIA facility received eight USAF F-101 Voodoos for training, two T-33 Shooting Star trainers for proficiency flying, a C-130 Hercules for cargo transport, a U-3A for administrative purposes, a helicopter for search and rescue, and a Cessna 180 for liaison use; and Lockheed provided an F-104 Starfighter for use as a chase plane.The first A-12 test aircraft was covertly trucked from Burbank on 26 February 1962, arrived at Groom Lake on 28 February, was assembled, and made its first flight 26 April 1962 when the base had over 1,000 personnel. Initially, all not connected with a test were herded into the mess hall before each takeoff. This was soon dropped as it disrupted activities and was impractical with the large number of flights. The closed airspace above Groom Lake was within the Nellis Air Force Range airspace, and pilots saw the A-12 20–30 times (at least one signed a secrecy agreement.).Groom was also the site of the first Lockheed D-21 drone test flight on 22 December 1964 (not launched until 5 March 1966). By the end of 1963, nine A-12s were at Area 51, assigned to the CIA operated \"1129th Special Activities Squadron\".Although it was decided on 10 January 1967 to phase out the CIA A-12 program, A-12s at Groom Lake occasionally deployed to Kadena AB, Okinawa, for Project Black Shield in 1967 (the 9 A-12s were stored at Palmdale in June 1968 and the 1129th SAS was inactivated.)\n\n\n=== D-21 Tagboard ===\n\nFollowing the loss of Gary Powers\' U-2 over the Soviet Union, there were several discussions about using the A-12 OXCART as an unpiloted drone aircraft. Although Kelly Johnson had come to support the idea of drone reconnaissance, he opposed the development of an A-12 drone, contending that the aircraft was too large and complex for such a conversion. However, the Air Force agreed to fund the study of a high-speed, high-altitude drone aircraft in October 1962. The Air Force interest seems to have moved the CIA to take action, the project designated \"Q-12\". By October 1963, the drone\'s design had been finalized. At the same time, the Q-12 underwent a name change. To separate it from the other A-12-based projects, it was renamed the \"D-21\". (The \"12\" was reversed to \"21\"). \"Tagboard\" was the project\'s code name.The first D-21 was completed in the spring of 1964 by Lockheed. After four more months of checkouts and static tests, the aircraft was shipped to Groom Lake and reassembled. It was to be carried by a two-seat derivative of the A-12, designated the \"M-21\". When the D-21/M-21 reached the launch point, the first step would be to blow off the D-21\'s inlet and exhaust covers. With the D-21/M-21 at the correct speed and altitude, the LCO would start the ramjet and the other systems of the D-21. \"With the D-21\'s systems activated and running, and the launch aircraft at the correct point, the M-21 would begin a slight pushover, the LCO would push a final button, and the D-21 would come off the pylon\".Difficulties were addressed throughout 1964 and 1965 at Groom Lake with various technical issues. Captive flights showed unforeseen aerodynamic difficulties. By late January 1966, more than a year after the first captive flight, everything seemed ready. The first D-21 launch was made on 5 March 1966 with a successful flight, with the D-21 flying 120 miles with limited fuel. A second D-12 flight was successful in April 1966 with the drone flying 1,200 miles, reaching Mach 3.3 and 90,000 feet. An accident on 30 July 1966 with a fully fueled D-21, on a planned checkout flight suffered from a non-start of the drone after its separation, causing it to collide with the M-21 launch aircraft. The two crewmen ejected and landed in the ocean 150 miles offshore. One crew member was picked up by a helicopter, but the other, having survived the aircraft breakup and ejection, drowned when sea water entered his pressure suit. Kelly Johnson personally cancelled the entire program, having had serious doubts from the start of the feasibility. A number of D-21s had already been produced, and rather than scrapping the whole effort, Johnson again proposed to the Air Force that they be launched from a B-52H bomber.By late summer of 1967, the modification work to both the D-21 (now designated D-21B) and the B-52Hs were complete. The test program could now resume. The test missions were flown out of Groom Lake, with the actual launches over the Pacific. The first D-21B to be flown was Article 501, the prototype. The first attempt was made on 28 September 1967, and ended in complete failure. As the B-52 was flying toward the launch point, the D-21B fell off the pylon. The B-52H gave a sharp lurch as the drone fell free. The booster fired and was \"quite a sight from the ground\". The failure was traced to a stripped nut on the forward right attachment point on the pylon. Several more tests were made, none of which met with success. However, the fact is that the resumptions of D-21 tests took place against a changing reconnaissance background. The A-12 had finally been allowed to deploy, and the SR-71 was soon to replace it. At the same time, new developments in reconnaissance satellite technology were nearing operation. Up to this point, the limited number of satellites available restricted coverage to the Soviet Union. A new generation of reconnaissance satellites could soon cover targets anywhere in the world. The satellites\' resolution would be comparable to that of aircraft, but without the slightest political risk. Time was running out for the Tagboard.Several more test flights, including two over China, were made from Beale AFB, California, in 1969 and 1970, to varying degrees of success. On 15 July 1971, Kelly Johnson received a wire canceling the D-21B program. The remaining drones were transferred by a C-5A and placed in dead storage. The tooling used to build the D-21Bs was ordered destroyed. Like the A-12 Oxcart, the D-21B Tagboard drones remained a Black airplane, even in retirement. Their existence was not suspected until August 1976, when the first group was placed in storage at the Davis-Monthan AFB Military Storage and Disposition Center. A second group arrived in 1977. They were labeled \"GTD-21Bs\" (GT stood for ground training).Davis-Monthan is an open base, with public tours of the storage area at the time, so the odd-looking drones were soon spotted and photos began appearing in magazines. Speculation about the D-21Bs circulated within aviation circles for years, and it was not until 1982 that details of the Tagboard program were released. However, it was not until 1993 that the B-52/D-21B program was made public. That same year, the surviving D-21Bs were released to museums.\n\n\n=== Foreign technology evaluation ===\n\nDuring the Cold War, one of the missions carried out by the United States was the test and evaluation of captured Soviet fighter aircraft. Beginning in the late 1960s, and for several decades, Area 51 played host to an assortment of Soviet-built aircraft. Under the HAVE DOUGHNUT, HAVE DRILL and HAVE FERRY programs, the first MiGs flown in the United States were used to evaluate the aircraft in performance, technical, and operational capabilities, pitting the types against U.S. fighters.This was not a new mission, as testing of foreign technology by the USAF began during World War II. After the war, testing of acquired foreign technology was performed by the Air Technical Intelligence Center (ATIC, which became very influential during the Korean War), under the direct command of the Air Materiel Control Department. In 1961 ATIC became the Foreign Technology Division (FTD), and was reassigned to Air Force Systems Command. ATIC personnel were sent anywhere where foreign aircraft could be found.\nThe focus of Air Force Systems Command limited the use of the fighter as a tool with which to train the front line tactical fighter pilots. Air Force Systems Command recruited its pilots from the Air Force Flight Test Center at Edwards Air Force Base, California, who were usually graduates from various test pilot schools. Tactical Air Command selected its pilots primarily from the ranks of the Weapons School graduates.In August 1966, Iraqi Air Force fighter pilot Captain Munir Redfa defected, flying his MiG-21 to Israel after being ordered to attack Iraqi Kurd villages with napalm. His aircraft was transferred to Groom Lake within a month to study. In 1968 the US Air Force and Navy jointly formed a project known as HAVE DOUGHNUT in which Air Force Systems Command, Tactical Air Command, and the U.S. Navy\'s Air Test and Evaluation Squadron Four (VX-4) flew this acquired Soviet made aircraft in simulated air combat training. Because U.S. possession of the Soviet MiG-21 was, itself, secret, it was tested at Groom Lake. A joint Air Force-Navy team was assembled for a series of dogfight tests.Comparisons between the F-4 and the MiG-21 indicated that, on the surface, they were evenly matched. But air combat was not just about technology. In the final analysis, it was the skill of the man in the cockpit. The HAVE DOUGHNUT tests showed this most strongly. When the Navy or Air Force pilots flew the MiG-21, the results were a draw; the F-4 would win some fights, the MiG-21 would win others. There were no clear advantages. The problem was not with the planes, but with the pilots flying them. The pilots would not fly either plane to its limits. One of the Navy pilots was Marland W. \"Doc\" Townsend, then commander of VF-121, the F-4 training squadron at NAS Miramar. He was an engineer and a Korean War veteran and had flown almost every navy aircraft. When he flew against the MiG-21, he would outmaneuver it every time. The Air Force pilots would not go vertical in the MiG-21. The HAVE DOUGHNUT project officer was Tom Cassidy, a pilot with VX-4, the Navy\'s Air Development Squadron at Point Mugu. He had been watching as Townsend \"waxed\" the air force MiG-21 pilots. Cassidy climbed into the MiG-21 and went up against Townsend\'s F-4. This time the result was far different. Cassidy was willing to fight in the vertical, flying the plane to the point where it was buffeting, just above the stall. Cassidy was able to get on the F-4\'s tail. After the flight, they realized the MiG-21 turned better than the F-4 at lower speeds. The key was for the F-4 to keep its speed up. What had happened in the sky above Groom Lake was remarkable. An F-4 had defeated the MiG-21; the weakness of the Soviet plane had been found. Further test flights confirmed what was learned. It was also clear that the MiG-21 was a formidable enemy. United States pilots would have to fly much better than they had been to beat it. This would require a special school to teach advanced air combat techniques.On 12 August 1968, two Syrian air force lieutenants, Walid Adham and Radfan Rifai, took off in a pair of MiG-17Fs on a training mission. They lost their way and, believing they were over Lebanon, landed at the Betzet Landing Field in northern Israel. (One version has it that they were led astray by an Arabic-speaking Israeli). Prior to the end of 1968 these MiG-17s were transferred from Israeli stocks and added to the Area 51 test fleet. The aircraft were given USAF designations and fake serial numbers so that they could be identified in DOD standard flight logs. As in the earlier program, a small group of Air Force and Navy pilots conducted mock dogfights with the MiG-17s. Selected instructors from the Navy\'s Top Gun school at NAS Miramar, California, were chosen to fly against the MiGs for familiarization purposes. Very soon, the MiG-17\'s shortcomings became clear. It had an extremely simple, even crude, control system which lacked the power-boosted controls of American aircraft. The F-4\'s twin engines were so powerful it could accelerate out of range of the MiG-17\'s guns in thirty seconds. It was important for the F-4 to keep its distance from the MiG-17. As long as the F-4 was one and a half miles from the MiG-17, it was outside the reach of the Soviet fighter\'s guns, but the MiG was within reach of the F-4\'s missiles.The data from the HAVE DOUGHNUT and HAVE DRILL tests were provided to the newly formed Top Gun school at NAS Miramar. By 1970, the HAVE DRILL program was expanded; a few selected fleet F-4 crews were given the chance to fight the MiGs. The most important result of Project HAVE DRILL is that no Navy pilot who flew in the project defeated the MiG-17 Fresco in the first engagement. The HAVE DRILL dogfights were by invitation only. The other pilots based at Nellis Air Force Base were not to know about the U.S.-operated MiGs. To prevent any sightings, the airspace above the Groom Lake range was closed. On aeronautical maps, the exercise area was marked in red ink. The forbidden zone became known as \"Red Square\".During the remainder of the Vietnam War, the Navy kill ratio climbed to 8.33 to 1. In contrast, the Air Force rate improved only slightly to 2.83 to 1. The reason for this difference was Top Gun. The Navy had revitalized its air combat training, while the Air Force had stayed stagnant. Most of the Navy MiG kills were by Top Gun graduates.In May 1973, Project HAVE IDEA was formed which took over from the older HAVE DOUGHNUT, HAVE FERRY and HAVE DRILL projects and the project was transferred to the Tonopah Test Range Airport. At Tonopah testing of foreign technology aircraft continued and expanded throughout the 1970s and 1980s.Area 51 also hosted another foreign materiel evaluation program called HAVE GLIB. This involved testing Soviet tracking and missile control radar systems. A complex of actual and replica Soviet-type threat systems began to grow around \"Slater Lake\", a mile northwest of the main base, along with an acquired Soviet \"Barlock\" search radar placed at Tonopah Air Force Station. They were arranged to simulate a Soviet-style air defense complex.\nThe Air Force began funding improvements to Area 51 in 1977 under project SCORE EVENT. In 1979, the CIA transferred jurisdiction of the Area 51 site to the Air Force Flight Test Center at Edwards AFB, California. Mr. Sam Mitchell, the last CIA commander of Area 51, relinquished command to USAF Lt. Col. Larry D. McClain.\n\n\n=== Have Blue/F-117 program ===\n\nThe Lockheed Have Blue prototype stealth fighter (a smaller proof-of-concept model of the F-117 Nighthawk) first flew at Groom in December 1977.In 1978, the Air Force awarded a full-scale development contract for the F-117 to Lockheed Corporation\'s Advanced Development Projects. On 17 January 1981 the Lockheed test team at Area 51 accepted delivery of the first full Scale Development (FSD) prototype 79–780, designated YF-117A. At 6:05 am on 18 June 1981 Lockheed Skunk Works test pilot Hal Farley lifted the nose of YF-117A 79–780\' off the runway of Area 51.Meanwhile, Tactical Air Command (TAC) decided to set up a group-level organization to guide the F-117A to an initial operating capability. That organization became the 4450th Tactical Group (Initially designated \"A Unit\"), which officially activated on 15 October 1979 at Nellis AFB, Nevada, although the group was physically located at Area 51. The 4450th TG also operated the A-7D Corsair II as a surrogate trainer for the F-117A, and these operations continued until 15 October 1982 under the guise of an avionics test mission.Flying squadrons of the 4450th TG were the 4450th Tactical Squadron (Initially designated \"I Unit\") activated on 11 June 1981, and 4451st Tactical Squadron (Initially designated \"P Unit\") on 15 January 1983. The 4450th TS, stationed at Area 51, was the first F-117A squadron, while the 4451st TS was stationed at Nellis AFB and was equipped with A-7D Corsair IIs painted in a dark motif, tail coded \"LV\". Lockheed test pilots put the YF-117 through its early paces. A-7Ds was used for pilot training before any F-117A\'s had been delivered by Lockheed to Area 51, later the A-7D\'s were used for F-117A chase testing and other weapon tests at the Nellis Range.\n15 October 1982 is important to the program because on that date Major Alton C. Whitley, Jr. became the first USAF 4450th TG pilot to fly the F-117A.Although ideal for testing, Area 51 was not a suitable location for an operational group, so a new covert base had to be established for F-117 operations.Tonopah Test Range Airport was selected for operations of the first USAF F-117 unit, the 4450th Tactical Group (TG). From October 1979, the Tonopah Airport base was reconstructed and expanded. The 6,000 ft runway was lengthened to 10,000 ft. Taxiways, a concrete apron, a large maintenance hangar, and a propane storage tank were added.By early 1982, four more YF-117As were operating at the southern end of the base, known as the \"Southend\" or \"Baja Groom Lake\". After finding a large scorpion in their offices, the testing team (Designated \"R Unit\") adopted it as their mascot and dubbed themselves the \"Baja Scorpions\". Testing of a series of ultra-secret prototypes continued at Area 51 until mid-1981, when testing transitioned to the initial production of F-117 stealth fighters. The F-117s were moved to and from Area 51 by C-5 during darkness to maintain security. The aircraft were defueled, disassembled, cradled, and then loaded aboard the C-5 at night, flown to Lockheed, and unloaded at night before reassembly and flight testing. Groom performed radar profiling, F-117 weapons testing, and training of the first group of frontline USAF F-117 pilots.\nWhile the \"Baja Scorpions\" were working on the F-117, there was also another group at work in secrecy, known as \"the Whalers\" working on Tacit Blue.  A fly-by-wire technology demonstration aircraft with curved surfaces and composite material, to evade radar, it was a prototype, and never went into production.  Nevertheless, this strange-looking aircraft was responsible for many of the stealth technology advances that were used on several other aircraft designs, and had a direct influence on the B-2; with first flight of Tacit Blue being performed on 5 February 1982, by Northrop Grumman test pilot, Richard G. Thomas.\nProduction FSD airframes from Lockheed were shipped to Area 51 for acceptance testing. As the Baja Scorpions tested the aircraft with functional check flights and L.O. verification, the operational airplanes were then transferred to the 4450th TG.On 17 May 1982, the move of the 4450th TG from Groom Lake to Tonopah was initiated, with the final components of the move completed in early 1983. Production FSD airframes from Lockheed were shipped to Area 51 for acceptance testing. As the Baja Scorpions tested the aircraft with functional check flights and L.O. verification, the operational airplanes were then transferred to the 4450th TG at Tonopah.\nThe R-Unit was inactivated on 30 May 1989. Upon inactivation, the unit was reformed as Detachment 1, 57th Fighter Weapons Wing (FWW). In 1990 the last F-117A (843) was delivered from Lockheed. After completion of acceptance flights at Area 51 of this last new F-117A aircraft, the flight test squadron continued flight test duties of refurbished aircraft after modifications by Lockheed. In February/March 1992 the test unit moved from Area 51 to the USAF Palmdale Plant 42 and was integrated with the Air Force Systems Command 6510th Test Squadron. Some testing, especially RCS verification and other classified activity was still conducted at Area 51 throughout the operational lifetime of the F-117. The recently inactivated (2008) 410th Flight Test Squadron traces its roots, if not its formal lineage to the 4450th TG R-unit.\n\n\n=== Later operations ===\n\nSince the F-117 became operational in 1983, operations at Groom Lake have continued. The base and its associated runway system were expanded, including expansion of housing and support facilities. In 1995, the federal government expanded the exclusionary area around the base to include nearby mountains that had hitherto afforded the only decent overlook of the base, prohibiting access to 3,972 acres (16.07 km2) of land formerly administered by the Bureau of Land Management. On 22 October 2015 a federal judge signed an order giving land that belonged to a Nevada family since the 1870s to the United States Air Force for expanding Area 51. According to the judge, the land that overlooked the base was taken to address security and safety concerns connected with their training and testing.\n\n\n== Legal status ==\n\n\n=== U.S. government\'s positions on Area 51 ===\n\nThe amount of information the United States government has been willing to provide regarding Area 51 has generally been minimal. The area surrounding the lake is permanently off-limits to both civilian and normal military air traffic. Security clearances are checked regularly; cameras and weaponry are not allowed. Even military pilots training in the NAFR risk disciplinary action if they stray into the exclusionary \"box\" surrounding Groom\'s airspace. Surveillance is supplemented using buried motion sensors. Area 51 is a common destination for Janet, the de facto name of a small fleet of passenger aircraft operated on behalf of the United States Air Force to transport military personnel, primarily from McCarran International Airport.\nThe USGS topographic map for the area only shows the long-disused Groom Mine. A civil aviation chart published by the Nevada Department of Transportation shows a large restricted area, defined as part of the Nellis restricted airspace. The National Atlas page showing federal lands in Nevada shows the area as lying within the Nellis Air Force Base. Higher resolution (and more recent) images from other satellite imagery providers (including Russian providers and the IKONOS) are commercially available. These show the runway markings, base facilities, aircraft, and vehicles.\nWhen documents that mention the Nevada Test Site (NTS) and operations at Groom are declassified, mentions of Area 51 and Groom Lake are routinely redacted. One exception is a 1967 memo from CIA director Richard Helms regarding the deployment of three OXCART aircraft from Groom to Kadena Air Base to perform reconnaissance over North Vietnam. Although most mentions of OXCART\'s home base are redacted in this document, as is a map showing the aircraft\'s route from there to Okinawa, the redactor appears to have missed one mention: page 15 (page 17 in the PDF), section No. 2 ends \"Three OXCART aircraft and the necessary task force personnel will be deployed from Area 51 to Kadena.\"On 25 June 2013, CIA released an official history of the U-2 and OXCART projects that officially acknowledged the existence of Area 51. The release was in response to a Freedom of Information Act request submitted in 2005 by Jeffrey T. Richelson of George Washington University\'s National Security Archive, and contain numerous references to Area 51 and Groom Lake, along with a map of the area.\n\n\n=== Environmental lawsuit ===\n\nIn 1994, five unnamed civilian contractors and the widows of contractors Walter Kasza and Robert Frost sued the USAF and the United States Environmental Protection Agency. Their suit, in which they were represented by George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley, alleged they had been present when large quantities of unknown chemicals had been burned in open pits and trenches at Groom. Biopsies taken from the complainants were analyzed by Rutgers University biochemists, who found high levels of dioxin, dibenzofuran, and trichloroethylene in their body fat. The complainants alleged they had sustained skin, liver, and respiratory injuries due to their work at Groom, and that this had contributed to the deaths of Frost and Kasza. The suit sought compensation for the injuries they had sustained, claiming the USAF had illegally handled toxic materials, and that the EPA had failed in its duty to enforce the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (which governs handling of dangerous materials). They also sought detailed information about the chemicals to which they were allegedly exposed, hoping this would facilitate the medical treatment of survivors. Congressman Lee H. Hamilton, former chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, told 60 Minutes reporter Lesley Stahl, \"The Air Force is classifying all information about Area 51 in order to protect themselves from a lawsuit.\"\nCiting the State Secrets Privilege, the government petitioned trial judge U.S. District Judge Philip Pro (of the United States District Court for the District of Nevada in Las Vegas) to disallow disclosure of classified documents or examination of secret witnesses, alleging this would expose classified information and threaten national security. When Judge Pro rejected the government\'s argument, President Bill Clinton issued a Presidential Determination, exempting what it called, \"The Air Force\'s Operating Location Near Groom Lake, Nevada\" from environmental disclosure laws. Consequently, Pro dismissed the suit due to lack of evidence. Turley appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, on the grounds that the government was abusing its power to classify material. Secretary of the Air Force Sheila E. Widnall filed a brief that stated that disclosures of the materials present in the air and water near Groom \"can reveal military operational capabilities or the nature and scope of classified operations.\" The Ninth Circuit rejected Turley\'s appeal, and the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear it, putting an end to the complainants\' case.\nThe President continues to annually issue a determination continuing the Groom exception. This, and similarly tacit wording used in other government communications, is the only formal recognition the U.S. Government has ever given that Groom Lake is more than simply another part of the Nellis complex.\nAn unclassified memo on the safe handling of F-117 Nighthawk material was posted on an Air Force web site in 2005. This discussed the same materials for which the complainants had requested information (information the government had claimed was classified). The memo was removed shortly after journalists became aware of it.\n\n\n== Civil aviation identification ==\nIn December 2007, airline pilots noticed that the base had appeared in their aircraft navigation systems\' latest Jeppesen database revision with the ICAO airport identifier code of KXTA and listed as \"Homey Airport\". The probably inadvertent release of the airport data led to advice by the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association (AOPA) that student pilots should be explicitly warned about KXTA, not to consider it as a waypoint or destination for any flight even though it now appears in public navigation databases.\n\n\n== Security ==\n\nThe perimeter of the base is marked out by orange posts and patrolled by guards in white pickup trucks and camouflage fatigues. The guards are popularly referred to as “camo dudes” by enthusiasts. The guards will not answer questions about their employers; however, according to the New York Daily News, there are indications they are employed through a contractor such as AECOM. Signage around the base perimeter advises that deadly force is authorized against trespassers.Technology is also heavily used to maintain the border of the base; this includes CCTV cameras and motion detectors. Some of these motion detectors are placed some distance away from the base on public land to notify guards of people approaching.\n\n\n== 1974 Skylab photography ==\n\nIn January 2006, space historian Dwayne A. Day published an article in online aerospace magazine The Space Review titled \"Astronauts and Area 51: the Skylab Incident\". The article was based on a memo written in 1974 to CIA director William Colby by an unknown CIA official. The memo reported that astronauts on board Skylab 4 had, as part of a larger program, inadvertently photographed a location of which the memo said:\n\nThere were specific instructions not to do this. <redacted> was the only location which had such an instruction.\n\nAlthough the name of the location was obscured, the context led Day to believe that the subject was Groom Lake. As Day noted:\n\n[I]n other words, the CIA considered no other spot on Earth to be as sensitive as Groom Lake.\nThe memo details debate between federal agencies regarding whether the images should be classified, with Department of Defense agencies arguing that it should, and NASA and the State Department arguing against classification. The memo itself questions the legality of unclassified images to be retroactively classified.\nRemarks on the memo, handwritten apparently by DCI (Director of Central Intelligence) Colby himself, read:\n\n[Secretary of State Rusk] did raise it—said State Dept. people felt strongly. But he inclined leave decision to me (DCI)—I confessed some question over need to protect since:\nUSSR has it from own sats\nWhat really does it reveal?\nIf exposed, don\'t we just say classified USAF work is done there?\nThe declassified documents do not disclose the outcome of discussions regarding the Skylab imagery. The behind-the-scenes debate proved moot as the photograph appeared in the Federal Government\'s Archive of Satellite Imagery along with the remaining Skylab 4 photographs, with no record of anyone noticing until Day identified it in 2007.\n\n\n=== Other satellite imagery ===\nOther satellite imagery is also available, including images that show what appears to be F-16 Fighting Falcon aircraft stationed on the base.\n\n\n== UFO and other conspiracy theories ==\nIts secretive nature and undoubted connection to classified aircraft research, together with reports of unusual phenomena, have led Area 51 to become a focus of modern UFO and other conspiracy theories. Some of the activities mentioned in such theories at Area 51 include:\nThe storage, examination, and reverse engineering of crashed alien spacecraft (including material supposedly recovered at Roswell), the study of their occupants (living and dead; see grey alien), and the manufacture of aircraft based on alien technology.\nMeetings or joint undertakings with extraterrestrials.\nThe development of exotic energy weapons for the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) or other weapons programs.\nThe development of means of weather control.\nThe development of time travel and teleportation technology.\nThe development of unusual and exotic propulsion systems related to the Aurora Program.\nActivities related to a supposed shadowy one world government or the Majestic 12 organization.Many of the hypotheses concern underground facilities at Groom or at Papoose Lake (also known as \"S-4 location\"), 8.5 miles (13.7 km) south, and include claims of a transcontinental underground railroad system, a disappearing airstrip (nicknamed the \"Cheshire Airstrip\", after Lewis Carroll\'s Cheshire cat) which briefly appears when water is sprayed onto its camouflaged asphalt, and engineering based on alien technology. Publicly available satellite imagery, however, reveals clearly visible landing strips at Groom Dry Lake, but not at Papoose Lake.\nIn the mid-1950s, civilian aircraft flew under 20,000 feet while military aircraft flew under 40,000 feet. Once the U-2 began flying at above 60,000 feet, an unexpected side effect was an increasing number of UFO sighting reports. Sightings occurred most often during early evenings hours, when airline pilots flying west saw the U-2\'s silver wings reflect the setting sun, giving the aircraft a \"fiery\" appearance. Many sighting reports came to the Air Force\'s Project Blue Book, which investigated UFO sightings, through air-traffic controllers and letters to the government. The project checked U-2 and later OXCART flight records to eliminate the majority of UFO reports it received during the late 1950s and 1960s, although it could not reveal to the letter writers the truth behind what they saw. Similarly, veterans of experimental projects such as OXCART and NERVA at Area 51 agree that their work (including 2,850 OXCART test flights alone) inadvertently prompted many of the UFO sightings and other rumors:\nThe shape of OXCART was unprecedented, with its wide, disk-like fuselage designed to carry vast quantities of fuel. Commercial pilots cruising over Nevada at dusk would look up and see the bottom of OXCART whiz by at 2,000-plus mph. The aircraft\'s titanium body, moving as fast as a bullet, would reflect the sun\'s rays in a way that could make anyone think, UFO.\nThey believe that the rumors helped maintain secrecy over Area 51\'s actual operations. While the veterans deny the existence of a vast underground railroad system, many of Area 51\'s operations did (and presumably still do) occur underground.Several people have claimed knowledge of events supporting Area 51 conspiracy theories. These have included Bob Lazar, who claimed in 1989 that he had worked at Area 51\'s \"Sector Four (S-4)\", said to be located underground inside the Papoose Range near Papoose Lake. Lazar has stated he was contracted to work with alien spacecraft that the U.S. government had in its possession.Similarly, the 1996 documentary Dreamland directed by Bruce Burgess included an interview with a 71-year-old mechanical engineer who claimed to be a former employee at Area 51 during the 1950s. His claims included that he had worked on a \"flying disc simulator\" which had been based on a disc originating from a crashed extraterrestrial craft and was used to train US pilots. He also claimed to have worked with an extraterrestrial being named \"J-Rod\" and described as a \"telepathic translator\".In 2004, Dan Burisch (pseudonym of Dan Crain) claimed to have worked on cloning alien viruses at Area 51, also alongside the alien named \"J-Rod\". Burisch\'s scholarly credentials are the subject of much debate, as he was apparently working as a Las Vegas parole officer in 1989 while also earning a PhD at State University of New York (SUNY).\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nNovels, films, television programs, and other fictional portrayals of Area 51 describe it—or a fictional counterpart—as a haven for extraterrestrials, time travel, and sinister conspiracies, often linking it with the Roswell UFO incident.\n\nIn the 1996 action film Independence Day, the United States military uses alien technology captured at Roswell to attack the invading alien fleet from Area 51. The president of the United States dismissed the site\'s existence as a myth until the secretary of defense revealed it to him, at which point he questioned where the off-the-books funding comes from. In the 2016 sequel, Independence Day: Resurgence, which takes place 20 years after the events of the first film, Area 51 has become the Space Defense Headquarters for Earth Space Defense (ESD).\nA novel, Area 51: The Dreamland Chronicles, a non-fiction book about Area 51 in Nevada written by David Darlington in 1997.\n\"Dreamland\" is a two part The X-Files episode set in and around Area 51 which involves Mulder swapping bodies with one of the base\'s employees.\nThe 2015 film Area 51 is a mockumentary which depicts four individuals attempting to sneak into Area 51.\nThe \"Hangar 51\" government warehouse of the Indiana Jones films stores, among other exotic items, the recovered Ark of the Covenant and an alien corpse from Roswell.\nIn the television series Stargate SG-1, Area 51 serves as a storage and testing facility for advanced weapon systems and aircraft/spacecraft designed using alien technology discovered after the Stargate was activated. The series states that prior to the Stargate\'s activation, rumors of alien technology or individuals existing at Area 51 were unfounded.\nThe television series Seven Days takes place inside Area 51, with the base containing a covert NSA time travel operation using alien technology recovered from Roswell.\nThe 1995 arcade game Area 51 is a light gun shooter set within the base.  The player has to defeat alien Kronn and zombie personnel in order to arm the base nuclear self-destruct and prevent further infestation.\nThe 2005 video game Area 51 is set in the base, and mentions the Roswell and moon landing hoax conspiracy theories.\nBob Mayer\'s Area 51 novel series (originally written under his pen name, Robert Doherty) is set on the base, and Operation Highjump is said to have been a cover for an expedition to excavate flying saucers buried under Antarctica\'s ice shelf by long-ago extraterrestrial visitors.\nThe 2010 video game Call of Duty: Black Ops features a DLC zombies level \'Moon\' in which part of the level is set in \'Hanger 18\' in Area 51. \'Hanger 18\' is also a multiplayer map again based in Area 51.\nThe 2000 video games Deus Ex and Perfect Dark feature Area 51.\nEpisode 7 of season 6 of the TV series Archer, titled \"Nellis\", is set in Area 51, where Pam and Krieger encounter extraterrestrials. However, Area 51 is fictionalized as part of nearby Nellis Air Force Base, rather than being part of Edwards Air Force Base.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nBlack project\nBlack site\nDugway Proving Ground, a restricted facility in the Utah desert.\nGroom Range, a mountain range north of the lakebed.\nKapustin Yar, a Russian rocket launch and development site.\nSpecial Access Program\nTitle 51 of the United States Code, National and Commercial Space Programs\nTonopah Test Range, also known as Area 52\nWoomera Test Range, a defense and aerospace testing area in Australia.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Specific ===\n\n\n=== General ===\n\n\n== External links ==\n\n\n=== General ===\nDreamland Resort – Detailed history of Area 51\nRoadrunners Internationale – Covering the history of the U2 and A-12 Blackbird spy plane projects\n\"How Area 51 Works\", on HowStuffWorks\nAngels in Paradise: The Development of the U-2 at Area 51 (Official video)\n\n\n=== Maps and photographs ===\nThe site Wikimapia\nDreamland Resort\'s map of Area 51 buildings\nDreamland Resort Maps – Maps of Area 51 and Google Earth plug-ins\nTopographic Map of the Emigrant Valley / Groom area\nPhotographs of McCarran EG&G terminal and JANET aircraft\nOfficial FAA aeronautical chart of Groom Lake\nHistorical pictures of Groom Lake, Groom Lake Mining District, Department of Special Collections, Digital Image Collections, University of Nevada, Reno, accessed 30 January 2009', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3b/4477th_Test_and_Evaluation_Squadron_MiG-17F_in_flight.jpg');

(151, '2007 Alderney UFO sighting', 'On 23 April 2007, captain Ray Bowyer was flying a routine passenger flight for the civilian airliner Aurigny Air Services, when he and his passengers gained progressively clearer views of two UFOs during a 12- to 15-minute period. Bowyer had 18 years of flying experience, and the 45-minute flight was one that he had completed every working day for more than 8 years.Their 80-mile (130 km) journey of 45 minutes took them from Southampton on the southern coast of England, southwestwards to Alderney, being 10 miles (16 kilometres) from France, and the northernmost of the Channel Islands. Their particular flight path had them converging on two enormous, seemingly stationary and identical airborne craft, which emanated brilliant yellow light. A pilot of a plane near Sark, some 25 mi (40 km) to the south, confirmed the presence, general position and altitude of the first object from the opposite direction.Radar traces also seemed to register the presence of two objects, which Ray Bowyer believed to be correlated with the position and time of the sighting. A study by David Clarke, however, could not establish a definite link, as the radar reflections of cargo or passenger ferries may have affected at least some of the readings. Bowyer disagreed with Clarke\'s team on the supposed link between the radar traces and ferries, and proposed that two solid airborne craft, which were not and could not have been manufactured on Earth, were working in unison that day, as suggested by the evidence that their sortie was coordinated in both time and space.\n\n\n== Prior observations ==\nOn 28 January 1994, pilot Jean-Charles Duboc and his crew observed a large lens-shaped craft over Taverny near Paris during an Airbus 320 flight from Nice to London. The reddish brown craft was observed at a distance of about 50 km for a duration of one minute when it assumed a stationary position at an altitude of 35,000 feet. At Taverny Air Base its presence was confirmed by a 50-second radar track. In retrospect, retired captain Duboc considered it to have been of a size comparable to that of the Alderney UFOs (perhaps 500 m across), and noted that it was positioned above the latter base, which served as the headquarters of the French Strategic Air Forces Command. At Alderney, the 23 April observation was preceded ten weeks earlier by a sighting of an initial two, and a subsequent 20 to 25 unexplained lights, which appeared in formation over the northern extremity of the island\'s coastline. These were noticed at 6:15 AM on 14 February by builder Paul Gaudion.\n\n\n== Flight A-Line 544 ==\nThe passengers of flight A-Line 544 departed in a BN2a Mk3 Trislander aircraft at about 2:00 PM in fine weather with good visibility for miles around, though a haze layer was present at 2,000 feet, and a continuous cloud layer at 10,000 feet. They rose to an altitude of 4,000 ft (1,200 m) and were cruising on autopilot about 10 mi (16 km) south of the Isle of Wight, when captain Bowyer was doing paper work and looking out for other aircraft. At this point he noticed, exactly in the direction of Guernsey, i.e. southwest and twelve o\'clock ahead, what appeared to be a brilliant yellow lamp or light. He considered that it might be an aeroplane, or alternatively, reflections from the ground, as Guernsey was immediately behind it. The reflection of the sun off a greenhouse was a possibility but, surprisingly, for a minute and then a couple of minutes, the apparition continued.\n\n\n=== Definite shape ===\n\nHe concluded that it was not a reflection but an emission of light. With his binoculars, he could make out a definite shape. The object was long and thin from his viewpoint, and was pointed at each end. The horizontal to vertical dimensions of its body were in a ratio of about 15:1. It was brilliant yellow, with a dark grey band enveloping it one third from the right, like a band around a cigar. With his 10× magnification binoculars, he could make out that it bore no relation to a normal aeroplane. He took his glasses off to exclude the possibility of a reflection from behind.His reaction was to make contact with Jersey ATC to confirm or exclude the possibility of traffic heading his way. Paul Kelly at Jersey ATC denied the presence of traffic in the said position, but could pick up a faint primary return radar signal, i.e. a signal without the additional transponder return. His instruments were however set to detect only moving objects.A passenger behind the captain confirmed what he was seeing, and pointed out a second similar craft, immediately behind the first: \"Upon nearing the object, a second identical shape appeared beyond the first. Both objects were of a flattened disk shape, with a dark area to [their] right. They were brilliant yellow, with light emanating from within, and I estimated them to be up to possibly a mile across.\" Jersey ATC was now able to get confirmation from the pilot of Blue Island Air, who, from 25 miles (40 km) to the south, also had visual contact with one object.\n\n\n=== Closest proximity ===\nWhile observing the objects, Bowyer had proceeded well beyond his descent point. At this closest approach a transitory feature of the nearest object became apparent. At the boundary between its radiant yellow area and the dark grey vertical band, he believed to perceive a pulsating interface where sparkling blues, greens and other hues were strobing up and down about once a second. Out of concern for the safety of his passengers, he started the descent to the runway and a haze layer obscured their final view of the objects. At no point during the flight however, had there been any interference with the aircraft\'s systems, instruments or radio communications.Captain Bowyer relates: \"This [was] a big object in the sky, a very, very big object. I did not want to be too close to it and it was at that time that we had to descend to land. We descended through the 2,000-foot (610 m) haze layer and lost sight of it.\" ... On Guernsey he related: \"There was no hiding it, they were just there. I wasn\'t too happy. I was quite glad to get on the ground ... and have a cup of tea.\"\n\n\n=== Postflight reporting and reflection ===\n\nCaptain Bowyer produced drawings of the two objects for his CAA Air Safety Report on the day of the sighting, and another in October 2007. Passengers Kate and John Russell, who sat three rows behind captain Bowyer, agreed to submit a report and also went public with their sightings. While on Alderney, captain Bowyer was able to study radar traces of the objects, and learned that he first observed the nearest object from some 55 miles away, rather than the 10 miles (16 km) or less that he initially assumed. This knowledge enabled him to construct an estimate of their size (up to a mile long) while on his return flight to Southampton, during which the two objects were nowhere to be seen.\n\n\n=== Ground-based observations ===\nBBC Radio Guernsey reported that two visitors to Sark enquired at their hotel as to what two bright yellow objects in the sky might be. The objects were observed during an afternoon walk on the 23rd, in the direction of Alderney. It is not known whether the radar station near Cap de la Hague, not far from the nuclear reprocessing site, observed any traces. Jersey Airport Radar Control, however, saved a radar recording of the incident, which was submitted to the CAA. They were recorded on Jersey Airport\'s primary, low-level radar system, but not on the secondary radar used for air traffic control, which was screening out stationary objects.The decluttered radar traces show two objects with slow movements during a period of 55 minutes. They were moving away from each other at about 6 knots, the first object northwards and towards the Casquets lighthouse, and the second southwards along the coast of Guernsey. They also appeared and disappeared simultaneously on radar, causing captain Bowyer to discount the possibility of them being cargo ferries. Bowyer also pointed out that the track of the northernmost object disappeared from radar after transiting the position of the lighthouse, a region so dangerous to shipping that it would be avoided by any cargo vessel.\n\n\n== National Press Club UFO meeting ==\n\n\n=== Sighting confirmation ===\nCaptain Ray Bowyer addressed the US National Press Club on 12 November 2007, and highlighted some details of the sighting.\n\"Good morning everybody. Thank you for coming this morning. My name is Ray Bowyer and I fly a civilian airliner, as captain. I\'ve been invited here, due to my sighting last April of multiple, as yet unidentified objects, over the Channel Islands region of the English Channel. This encounter lasted for fifteen minutes, and the first object being visible from 55 miles\' distance. On nearing the object a second identical shape appeared beyond the first. Both objects were of a flattened disk shape with a dark area to [their] right. They were brilliant yellow, with light emanating from within, and I estimated them to be up to possibly a mile across. I found myself astounded but curious, but at 12 miles\' distance these objects were becoming uncomfortably large, and I was glad to descend and land the aircraft. Many of my passengers saw the objects as did the pilots of another aircraft, 25 miles further south. There is also possible radar information still being investigated. A team headed by Dr. David Clarke looking at this case will shortly [...] publish a report but I understand that at this time no definitive solution has been discovered to explain the sighting as yet.\"\n\n\n=== Appeal for transparency ===\nDuring the address he also highlighted a supposed secrecy and suppression of pilots\' UFO sighting reports in the United States.\n\"I\'ve taken note of some of the differences between the British and the U.S. reporting system. It appears that attitudes on opposite sides of the Atlantic are very different when it comes to the required reporting and recording of this type of event. Air Law stipulates quite clearly that if an operating crew of an aircraft see another aircraft at a place that it shouldn\'t be, then at the earliest opportunity the whole scenario is to be reported to the relevant authorities.In my case the British Civil Aviation Authority knew within 20 minutes of the sighting what was seen, as described in a flight log, and faxed directly to the relevant CAA office. The military were informed by Jersey Air Traffic Control at the same time. This is not an option. This is an obligation that crews react in this manner. In my experience, having reported the incident as required has had no negative effect, and there was no problem with me talking about this on British television. Indeed, my company, Aurigny Air Services, have offered every support to [date]. The assistance of Jersey Air Traffic Control in releasing recorded information to myself and the [...] investigating team, has been of great benefit. I did not feel that I was in any danger of being ridiculed, because all I did was to report what actually happened as was my duty as operating aircrew.I heard about the multiple witness sightings at Chicago O\'Hare Airport, about a year ago now, on November the 7th, 2006. I was surprised to hear how it was handled. Despite many pilots and airport personnel witnessing the object hovering over the terminal, there was no investigation at all by the FAA. It appears as if pressure may have been applied to crew members by their company not to discuss this incident. I would have been shocked if I was told that the CAA in the UK would obstruct an investigation, or if the CAA told me that what I had seen was something entirely different. But it seems as if pilots in America are used to this sort of thing here.I would urge all fellow aircrew to report whatever they see as soon as possible and to stand up and be counted. It is only when crucial and critical witnesses such as air crew make reports that the authorities will be kick-started into a broader investigation of [these] phenomena. Thank you very much.\"\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of reported UFO sightings\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c5/Airplane_silhouette.svg'),

(153, 'Emilcin Abduction', 'Emilcin Abduction was a supposed alien abduction of farmer, Jan Wolski in May 1978. There was little media attention at the time. A monument was subsequently erected in Emilcin, Poland, at the site where the abduction is said to have taken place.\n\n\n== Background ==\nJan Wolski (; 29 May 1907 – 8 January 1990) was out driving a horse-drawn cart early on 10 May 1978 when he says he was jumped by two \"short, green-faced humanoid entities\" about 5 feet (1.5 m) tall. The two beings jumped onto Wolski\'s cart and, according to Wolski, sat next to him and started to speak in a strange language. Originally he had mistaken them for foreigners because of their \"slanted eyes and prominent cheekbones.\" Wolski drove his cart, with the two beings aboard, to a clearing where he says a large object was hovering.\n\n\n=== The craft ===\nAccording to Wolski, a purely white unidentified flying object, about 14.75 feet (4.5 m) – 16.5 feet (5.0 m) in height and \"as long as a bus,\" hovered in the air at an altitude of about 16 feet (4.9 m). There were no notable external features of the craft (i.e. lights, joints, etc.). Wolski mentioned that there were four objects on the craft made of a black material that appeared to be drill-like in appearance, which generated a humming sound. An elevator-like platform attached to the hovering craft descended to the ground. (Artist\'s Rendition 1 2)\nWolski then claims that he was taken aboard the ship with two additional entities he met near the flying object. He was then gestured to \"undress\" (take off his clothes). There were about eight or ten benches situated around the craft, each the size for one person to sit in. There were some rooks in front of the door which was moving its legs and wings but seemed to be immobilized. Wolski claims that he was then examined with a tool that resembled two dishes or \"saucers.\" After this, he was ordered to redress, and it was then that he noticed there were no lights or windows on the craft, only the daylight coming through the craft\'s door. Entities ate and offered him something like icicles but he refused. The craft\'s interior was described as black with a greyish tint, similar to that of the creatures\' outfits.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nAfterwards, Wolski returned home to his family and notified them of what had just happened, urging them to come see the floating craft. He notified his sons who called to other neighbours, and together they went to investigate the site. The grass where the craft had been had signs of usage in it, being \"trodden down covered with dew and paths coming in all directions.\" Wolski returned home, leaving the rest of the neighbours and family at the site. Wolski\'s sons claim that there were footprints left behind by the beings, though they did not detail whether the footprints were larger or smaller than their own.\nA six-year-old boy claims to have witnessed a bus-like craft hover over a barn, then climb high into the sky and vanish.Wolski explained these memories in an interview with Henryk Pomorski and Krystyna Adamczyk in July 1978, two months following the incident. The audio tape of the interview was kept in a private archive for a long time before being released to the public.\n\n\n== Memorial ==\nIn 2005, a memorial was constructed in Emilcin at 51°8′2.63″N 22°2′16.16″E to commemorate the alien abduction of Jan Wolski. The text in Polish, read: \"On 10 May 1978 in Emilcin a UFO object landed.

(158, 'Alien abduction claimants', 'Alien abduction claimants (also called abductees and experiencers) are people who have claimed to have been abducted by aliens. The term \"abduction phenomenon\" describes claims of non-human creatures kidnapping individuals and temporarily removing them from familiar terrestrial surroundings. The abductors, usually interpreted as being extraterrestrial life forms, are said to subject experiencers to a forced medical examination that emphasizes the alleged experiencer\'s reproductive system.The first alien abduction narrative to be widely publicized was the Betty and Barney Hill abduction in 1961. Since that time, the credibility and mental health of alleged experiencers has taken on great importance to those seeking to determine the veracity of the abduction claims. Mainstream academics and members of the skeptics movement generally doubt that the phenomenon occurs literally as reported, and have proposed a variety of alternative explanations.\nSuch skeptics often argue that the phenomenon might be a modern-day folk myth or vivid dreams occurring in a state of sleep paralysis. On the contrary ufologists and paranormal researchers hold positions closer to the face-value of abduction claims. The discovery of common psychological traits shared by abductees would have the potential to determine a neurological explanation for the claims, while other commonalities or differences may serve to reinforce that the claims of the experiencers do in fact correspond with objective reality.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nAs a category, abductees have some psychological characteristics that render their testimony suspect.  Dr. Elizabeth Slater conducted a blind study of nine abduction claimants and found them to be prone to \"mildly paranoid thinking,\" nightmares and having a weak sexual identity. According to Yvonne Smith, some alleged abductees test positive for lupus, despite not showing any symptoms.\n\n\n== Abductees and the paranormal ==\nAlleged abductees are seen by many pro-abduction researchers to have a higher incidence of non-abduction related paranormal events and abilities. Following an abduction experience, these paranormal abilities and occurrences sometimes seem to become more pronounced. According to investigator Benton Jamison, abduction experiencers who report UFO sightings that should have been, but are not, reported by independent corroborating witnesses often seem to \"be \'psychic personalities\' in the sense of Jan Ehrenwald.\"Sometimes abductees experience the sensation of being both human and alien at the same time, a phenomenon Joe Nyman calls \"dual reference.\" Dual reference emerges in hypnotic regression sessions wherein the subject reports pre-birth or pre-life existence as one of the same species as those he or she would later report abducting them. When presenting a paper on the subject to the 1992 MIT alien abduction conference several investigators in attendance accused him of leading his subjects in his hypnotic regression sessions, possibly encouraging them to confabulate. However, some of Nyman\'s subjects disagreed with the accusations and defended him.\n\n\n== Age demographics ==\nIn a study investigating the motivations of the alleged abductors, Jenny Randles found that in each of the four cases out of fifty total where the experiencer was over forty years of age or more, they were rejected by the aliens for \"what they (the experiencers) usually inferred to be a medical reason.\" Randles concludes \"[T]he abduction is essentially a young person\'s experience.\" Given the reproductive focus of the alleged abductions it is not surprising that one man reported being rejected because he had undergone a vasectomy. It could also be partially because people over the age of forty are less likely to have \"hormonic\" or reproductive activity going on.\n\n\n=== Children as abductees ===\nAlthough abduction and other UFO-related reports are usually made by adults, sometimes young children report similar experiences. These child-reports often feature very specific details in common with reports of abduction made by adults, including the circumstances, narrative, entities and aftermaths of the alleged occurrences. Often these young abductees have family members who have reported having abduction experiences. Family involvement in the military, or a residence near a military base is also common amongst child abduction claimants.Deborah Truncale, a pro-abduction researcher believes that the reports made by children should be taken similarly seriously to those made by adults. She notes several characteristic behaviors of children fictionalizing stories, such as pausing to think, attempting to anticipate the reaction of the listener, or trying to fake convincing eye contact. Truncale sees child abduction claimants as lacking these mannerisms, instead, she says, they can be described as \"generally more animated [than children making up stories] and speak[ing] quickly, [they recall] an account without the behavior that involves...story telling.\"Some pro-abduction researchers argue that children do not include the image of the Grey-type alien as part of their \"image bank,\" and consequently their reports are not likely derived from cultural depictions of UFO related phenomena. Budd Hopkins once investigated \"several mask and novelty stores\" for a commercially produced grey alien costume for children, but could not. He feels that this supports the hypothesis that children are not familiar with \"greys.\" John Carpenter also believes that young children are not \"contaminated\" with cultural images of greys. He reports that a fellow investigator who is a school teacher requested her children to draw an alien, and that none of them drew a Grey-like being.Children seem to react to their alleged abduction experiences differently from adult claimants. Many alleged adult experiencers report doubting their sanity or the veracity of what they believed happened to them. Children, by contrast, never seem to doubt that their experiences happened to them. For an adult, an abduction experience can challenge much of what they believe about the world. Children however, by virtue of being in a formative stage of development, more readily assimilate the experience into their developing worldview.Many repeat-abductees report that, as children from the ages of 2-6, they would be visited by balls of light that would enter their room at night. These balls would seem to play games with children and fly around the room. Some have interpreted them as being a way for the alleged abductees to develop their psychic abilities the way a physical ball helps develop coordination and athletic abilities. As such these intangible orbs have been dubbed \"psychic toys.\" Although these phantasms are alleged to have appeared regularly, no corroborating sightings from members of the abductees\' families or others that may have been expected to see them have been reported.\n\n\n==== Hopkins Image Recognition Test ====\nUFO and abduction researcher Budd Hopkins has designed an image recognition test (known as the Hopkins Image Recognition Test, or HIRT) for Children that he claims is helpful in verifying legitimate occurrences of alien abduction. There are ten different illustrated flash cards in the HIRT, nine of which depict \"images from myth, from the real world, and from popular culture.\" The tenth image is the \"grey\" type entity commonly associated with claims of abduction. The images are drawn simply in black and white, featuring characters drawn in what Hopkins calls a \"neutral and inexpressive\" fashion. This is supposed to be a preventative measure intended to keep the images from affecting the child\'s responses on an emotional basis.\n\n\n===== Procedure =====\nThe test would be administered to two groups of about 10-12 children individually, one group being composed of children who are thought to be possible abduction experiencers, and a control group. Furthermore, the test consisted of three parts. The first portion test is treated as a flash-card type children\'s game where the administrator asks the child to identify the figure depicted on the card presented to them. Hopkins reports that when the allegedly abducted children encounter the Grey face, they frequently will respond by recounting a detailed abduction narrative containing elements extremely similar to those found in claims made by adults, he even recalls an instance where a child-claimant reported a \"baby presentation\" scenario. Parents have sometimes supposedly seemed disturbed by their children\'s responses to the \"Gray\" face. He says no child in the control group of any test session has recognized or attached significance to the \"Grey\" image.During the second phase of the HIRT, the administrator asks each child to separate the flash cards into two piles, one pile for those depicting characters they like, and one for those depicting characters they dislike. As the child divides up the cards, the administrator asks for the child to explain the reasons they liked or disliked the characters on the cards. Hopkins says that abduction-candidate children usually file the alien head under the \"dislike\" category for \"[the reasons] we have come to expect.\" By contrast, control group children often file the alien head under the \"like\" category, because \"they had no reason to dislike something they didn\'t recognize.\"Stage three involves more active participation on the part of the children. The administrator will ask the child to make up a story about an imaginary encounter with the character depicted on it. This usually acts as a trigger for reporting an abduction account in the potential abductees if earlier tests had not elicited an explicit account of this type.\n\n\n===== Criticism =====\nHopkins\' test has been criticized by abduction researcher David Gotlib, who felt that Hopkins\'s use of terminology in describing the test implied it had been evaluated and standardized in a scientifically rigorous way, when in fact it had not. Hopkins withdrew the offending statements. Psychologist Richard Boylan raised a similar objection to the way Hopkins had hyped the test. Boylan also voiced criticism of the test itself, noting that the grey face was \"the only anomalous figure in the set,\" and that a \"spooky narrative\" in response to the image was to be expected. This, he said, was \"obvious, but is not probative.\"\n\n\n== Prevalence ==\nReports of the abduction phenomenon have been made around the world, but are less common outside of English speaking countries, especially the United States.\n\n\n=== The Roper Poll ===\nIn 1991, Hopkins, Jacobs and sociologist Dr. Ron Westrum commissioned a Roper Poll in order to determine how many Americans might have experienced the abduction phenomenon. Of nearly 6,000 Americans, 119 answered in a way that Hopkins et al. interpreted as supporting their ET interpretation of the abduction phenomenon. Based on this figure, Hopkins estimated that nearly four million Americans might have been abducted by extraterrestrials. The poll results are available at this external link: Abduction by Aliens or Sleep Paralysis \n\n\n==== Criticism ====\nWriting in Skeptical Inquirer, psychologist Susan Blackmore notes that based on her analysis, \"I conclude that the claim of the Roper Poll, that 3.7 million Americans have probably been abducted, is false.\"\n\n\n== List of notable abduction claimants ==\nBetty and Barney Hill\nStan Romanek\nTravis Walton\nWhitley Strieber\n\n\n== See also ==\nAlien abduction (Notable abduction claims)\nAlien abduction insurance\n\n\n== References ==', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bd/Ambox_globe_content.svg');

(159, 'Ancient astronauts', '\"Ancient astronauts\" (or \"ancient aliens\") refers to the pseudoscientific idea that intelligent extraterrestrial beings visited Earth and made contact with humans in antiquity and prehistoric times. Proponents suggest that this contact influenced the development of modern cultures, technologies, and religions, and even human biology. A common position is that deities from most, if not all, religions are extraterrestrial in origin, and that advanced technologies brought to Earth by ancient astronauts were interpreted as evidence of divine status by early humans.The idea that ancient astronauts existed is not taken seriously by most academics, and has received no credible attention in peer reviewed studies. Furthermore, it is argued that some ancient astronaut proponents such as Erich von Däniken have fabricated evidence and distorted the facts of archeological research.Well-known proponents in the latter half of the 20th century who have written numerous books or appear regularly in mass media include von Däniken, Zecharia Sitchin, Robert K. G. Temple, Giorgio A. Tsoukalos and David Hatcher Childress.\n\n\n== Overview ==\n\nProponents of the ancient astronaut hypothesis often maintain that humans are either descendants or creations of extraterrestrial intelligence (ETI) who landed on Earth thousands of years ago.  An associated idea is that humans evolved independently, but that much of human knowledge, religion, and culture came from extraterrestrial visitors in ancient times, in that ancient astronauts acted as a \"mother culture\".  Some ancient astronaut proponents also believe that travelers from outer space, referred to as \"astronauts\" (or \"spacemen\") built many of the structures on Earth (such as Egyptian pyramids and the Moai stone heads of Easter Island) or aided humans in building them.Various terms are used to reference claims about ancient astronauts, such as ancient aliens, ancient ufonauts, ancient space pilots, paleocontact, astronaut- or alien gods, or paleo- or Bible-SETI (search for extraterrestrial intelligence).\n\n\n== Ancient astronauts hypothesis of creation ==\nProponents argue that the evidence for ancient astronauts comes from documentary gaps in historical and archaeological records, and they also maintain that absent or incomplete explanations of historical or archaeological data point to the existence of ancient astronauts.  The evidence is argued to include archaeological artifacts that they deem anachronistic, or beyond the accepted technical capabilities of the historical cultures with which they are associated.  These are sometimes referred to as \"out-of-place artifacts\"; and include artwork and legends which are interpreted in a modern sense as depicting extraterrestrial contact or technologies.Scholars have responded that gaps in contemporary knowledge are not evidence of the existence of ancient astronauts, and that advocates have not provided any convincing anecdotal or physical evidence of an artifact that might conceivably be the product of ETI contact. According to astrophysicist Carl Sagan, \"In the long litany of \'ancient astronaut\' pop archaeology, the cases of apparent interest have perfectly reasonable alternative explanations, or have been misreported, or are simple prevarications, hoaxes and distortions\".\n\n\n== Hypothesis origins and proponents ==\nPaleocontact or \"ancient astronaut\" narratives first appeared in the early science fiction of the late 19th to early 20th century.  The idea was proposed in earnest by Harold T. Wilkins in 1954; it received some consideration as a serious hypothesis during the 1960s. Critics of the theory emerged throughout the 1970s, discrediting Von Daniken\'s theory. Ufologists separated the idea from the UFO controversy. By the early 1980s little remaining support of the theory could be found.\n\n\n=== Shklovski and Sagan ===\n\nIn Intelligent Life in the Universe (1966) astrophysicists I. S. Shklovski and Carl Sagan devote a chapter to the argument that scientists and historians should seriously consider the possibility that extraterrestrial contact occurred during recorded history; however, Shklovski and Sagan stressed that these ideas were speculative and unproven. Shklovski and Sagan argued that sub-lightspeed interstellar travel by extraterrestrial life was a certainty when considering technologies that were established or feasible in the late 1960s; that repeated instances of extraterrestrial visitation to Earth were plausible; and that pre-scientific narratives can offer a potentially reliable means of describing contact with aliens.\nSagan illustrates this hypothesis by citing the 1786 expedition of French explorer Jean-François de Galaup, comte de La Pérouse, which made the earliest first contact between European and Tlingit cultures. The contact story was preserved as an oral tradition by the preliterate Tlingit.  Over a century after its occurrence it was then recorded by anthropologist George T. Emmons.  Although it is framed in a Tlingit cultural and spiritual paradigm, the story remained an accurate telling of the 1786 encounter.  According to Sagan, this proved how \"under certain circumstances, a brief contact with an alien civilization will be recorded in a re-constructible manner.  He further states that the reconstruction will be greatly aided if 1) the account is committed to written record soon after the event; 2) a major change is effected in the contacted society; and 3) no attempt is made by the contacting civilization to disguise its exogenous nature.\"Additionally, Shklovski and Sagan cited tales of Oannes, a fishlike being attributed with teaching agriculture, mathematics, and the arts to early Sumerians, as deserving closer scrutiny as a possible instance of paleocontact due to its consistency and detail.In his 1979 book Broca\'s Brain, Sagan suggested that he and Shklovski might have inspired the wave of 1970s ancient astronaut books, expressing disapproval of \"von Däniken and other uncritical writers\" who seemingly built on these ideas not as guarded speculations but as \"valid evidence of extraterrestrial contact.\" Sagan argued that while many legends, artifacts, and purported out-of-place artifacts were cited in support of ancient astronaut hypotheses, \"very few require more than passing mention\" and could be easily explained with more conventional hypotheses. Sagan also reiterated his earlier conclusion that extraterrestrial visits to Earth were possible but unproven, and improbable.\n\n\n=== Erich von Däniken ===\n\nErich von Däniken was a leading proponent of this hypothesis in the late 1960s and early 1970s, gaining a large audience through the 1968 publication of his best-selling book Chariots of the Gods? and its sequels.\nAccording to von Däniken, certain artifacts require a more sophisticated technological ability in their construction than that which was available to the ancient cultures who constructed them. Von Däniken maintains that these artifacts were constructed either directly by extraterrestrial visitors or by humans who learned the necessary knowledge from said visitors. These include Stonehenge, Pumapunku, the Moai of Easter Island, the Great Pyramid of Giza, and the ancient Baghdad electric batteries.\n\nVon Däniken writes that ancient art and iconography throughout the world illustrates air and space vehicles, non-human but intelligent creatures, ancient astronauts, and artifacts of an anachronistically advanced technology. Von Däniken also states that geographically separated historical cultures share artistic themes, which he argues imply a common origin. One such example is von Däniken\'s interpretation of the sarcophagus lid recovered from the tomb of the Classic-era Maya ruler of Palenque, Pacal the Great. Von Däniken writes that the design represented a seated astronaut. The iconography and accompanying Maya text, however, identifies it as a portrait of the ruler himself with the World Tree of Maya mythology.\nThe origins of many religions are interpreted by von Däniken as reactions to encounters with an alien race. According to his view, humans considered the technology of the aliens to be supernatural and the aliens themselves to be gods. Von Däniken states that the oral and written traditions of most religions contain references to alien visitors in the way of descriptions of stars and vehicular objects travelling through air and space. One such is Ezekiel\'s revelation in the Old Testament, which Däniken interprets as a detailed description of a landing spacecraft (The Spaceships of Ezekiel).\nVon Däniken\'s hypotheses became popularized in the U.S. after the NBC-TV documentary In Search Of Ancient Astronauts hosted by Rod Serling and the film Chariots of the Gods.\nCritics argue that von Däniken misrepresented data, that many of his claims were unfounded, and that none of his core claims have been validated. In particular the Christian creationist community is highly critical of many of von Däniken\'s work. Young Earth creationist author Clifford A. Wilson published Crash Go the Chariots in 1972 in which he attempted to discredit all the claims made in Chariots of the Gods.\n\n\n=== Zecharia Sitchin ===\n\nZecharia Sitchin\'s series The Earth Chronicles, beginning with The 12th Planet, revolves around Sitchin\'s unique interpretation of ancient Sumerian and Middle Eastern texts, megalithic sites, and artifacts from around the world.  He hypothesizes that the gods of old Mesopotamia were astronauts from the planet \"Nibiru\", which Sitchin states the Sumerians believed to be a remote \"12th planet\" (counting the Sun, Moon, and Pluto as planets) associated with the god Marduk. According to Sitchin, Nibiru continues to orbit our sun on a 3,600-year elongated orbit.  Modern astronomy has found no evidence to support Sitchin\'s ideas.Sitchin argues that there are Sumerian texts which tell the story that 50 Anunnaki, inhabitants of a planet named Nibiru, came to Earth approximately 400,000 years ago with the intent of mining raw materials, especially gold, for transport back to Nibiru. With their small numbers they soon grew tired of the task and set out to genetically engineer laborers to work the mines. After much trial and error they eventually created Homo sapiens sapiens: the \"Adapa\" (model man) or Adam of later mythology. Sitchin contended the Anunnaki were active in human affairs until their culture was destroyed by global catastrophes caused by the abrupt end of the last ice age some 12,000 years ago. Seeing that humans survived and all they had built was destroyed, the Anunnaki left Earth after giving humans the opportunity and means to govern themselves. Sitchin\'s work has not received mainstream scholarly support and has been roundly criticized by professionals that have reviewed his hypotheses. Semitic languages scholar Michael S. Heiser says that many of Sitchin\'s translations of Sumerian and Mesopotamian words are not consistent with Mesopotamian cuneiform bilingual dictionaries, produced by ancient Akkadian scribes.Alan F. Alford, author of Gods of the New Millennium (1996), was an adherent of the ancient astronaut hypothesis. Much of his work draws on Sitchin\'s hypotheses. However, he now finds fault with Sitchin\'s hypothesis after deeper analysis, stating that: \"I am now firmly of the opinion that these gods personified the falling sky; in other words, the descent of the gods was a poetic rendition of the cataclysm myth which stood at the heart of ancient Near Eastern religions.\"\n\n\n=== Robert Temple ===\n\nRobert K. G. Temple\'s 1976 book, The Sirius Mystery argues that the Dogon people of northwestern Mali preserved an account of extraterrestrial visitation from around 5,000 years ago. He quotes various lines of evidence, including advanced astronomical knowledge inherited by the tribe, descriptions, and comparative belief systems with ancient civilizations such as ancient Egypt and Sumer. His work draws heavily on the studies of cultural anthropologists Marcel Griaule and Germaine Dieterlen.His conclusions have been criticized by scientists, who point out discrepancies within Temple\'s account, and suggested that the Dogon may have received some of their astronomical information recently, probably from European sources, and may have misrepresented Dogon ethnography.\n\n\n=== UFO religions ===\n\nVarious new religious movements including some branches of theosophy, Scientology, Raëlism, and Heaven\'s Gate believe in ancient and present-day contact with extraterrestrial intelligence. Many of these faiths see both ancient scriptures and recent revelations as connected with the action of aliens from other planetary systems. Psychologists have found that UFO religions have similarities which suggest that members of these groups consciously or subliminally associate enchantment with the memes of science fiction.\n\n\n== Evidence cited by proponents ==\n\nAmong scientists, the consensus is that the ancient astronaut hypothesis is not  per se wrong, but unnecessary. The \"mysteries\" cited as evidence for the hypothesis can be explained without having to invoke ancient astronauts; proponents look for mysteries where none exist. Since ancient astronauts are unnecessary, Occam\'s razor should be applied and the hypothesis rejected according to the scientific consensus.\n\n\n=== Ancient religious texts ===\nProponents cite ancient mythologies to support their viewpoints based on the idea that ancient creation myths of gods who descend from the heavens to Earth to create or instruct humanity are representations of alien visitors, whose superior technology accounts for their perception as gods. Proponents draw an analogy to occurrences in modern times when isolated cultures are exposed to Western technology, such as when, in the early 20th century, \"cargo cults\" were discovered in the South Pacific: cultures who believed various Western ships and their cargo to be sent from the gods as fulfillment of prophecies concerning their return.The ancient Sumerian myth of Enûma Eliš, inscribed on cuneiform tablets and part of the Library of Ashurbanipal, says humankind was created to serve gods called the \"Annunaki\". Hypothesis proponents believe that the Annunaki were aliens who came to earth to mine gold for their own uses.  According to the Enuma Elish story, the Annunaki realized mining gold was taking a toll on their race, and then created the human race as slaves.The scholar of Christ mythicism Dorothy Murdock criticized ancient astronauts theories, asserting that they \"may be prompted by the same type of motivation that produced the Bible, a chronicle largely consisting of the plagiarized myths of other cultures\" refashioned as historical facts concerning purported historical characters, and may be driven by the attempt to validate Biblical mythology as historical under a new pseudo-scientific interpretation.\n\n\n==== Ramayana ====\n\nIn Hindu mythology, the gods and their avatars travel from place to place in flying vehicles (see Vimana). There are many mentions of these flying machines in the Ramayana, which used by Tamil king Ravana from Sri Lanka dates to the 5th or 4th century BCE. Below are some examples:\nFrom Book 6, Canto CXXIII: The Magic Car:\n\nIs not the wondrous chariot mine,Named Pushpak, wrought by hands divine.\n…\nThis chariot, kept with utmost care,\nWill waft thee through the fields of air,\nAnd thou shalt light unwearied down\nIn fair Ayodhyá\'s royal town.\nFrom Book 6, Canto CXXIV: The Departure:\nSwift through the air, as Ráma chose,The wondrous car from earth arose.\nAnd decked with swans and silver wings\nBore through the clouds its freight of kings.\n\nErich von Däniken discusses the Ramayana and the vimanas in Chapter 6 of Chariots of the Gods? suggesting that they were \"space vehicles\".  To support his hypothesis, he offers a quotation which he says is from an 1889 translation of the Mahabharata by C. Roy: \"Bhima flew with his Vimana on an enormous ray which was as brilliant as the sun and made a noise like the thunder of a storm\".\n\n\n==== Book of Genesis and Book of Enoch ====\nThe Book of Genesis, Chapter 6 verses 1-2 and 4, states:When human beings began to increase in number on the earth and daughters were born to them, the sons of God saw that the daughters of humans were beautiful, and they married any of them they chose....The Nephilim were on the earth in those days—and also afterward—when the sons of God went to the daughters of humans and had children by them.— Genesis 6:1–4 (New International Version)\nMany Christians consider these groups to be the different families of Adam and Eve\'s children.  Another interpretation is that the Nephilim are the children of the \"sons of God\" and \"daughters of humans\", although scholars are uncertain. The King James Version translates \"Nephilim\" as \"giants\" (or Gibborim).  Ancient Astronaut theorists argue that Adam and Eve ate of the forbidden fruit in order \"to be godlike\", and this was the first step in human evolution.\nThe first part of the apocryphal Book of Enoch expands and interprets Genesis 6:1: that the \"sons of God\" were a group of 200 \"angels\" called \"Watchers\", who descended to Earth to breed with humans. Their offspring are the Nephilim, \"giants\" who \"consumed all the acquisitions of men\". When humans could no longer sustain the Nephilim, they turned against humanity. The Watchers also instructed humans in metallurgy and metalworking, cosmetics, sorcery, astrology, astronomy, and meteorology. God then ordered the Watchers to be imprisoned in the ground, and created the Great Flood (or the numerous Deluge myths) to rid Earth of the Nephilim and of the humans given knowledge by the Watchers. To ensure humanity\'s survival, Noah is forewarned of the oncoming destruction. Because they disobeyed God, the book describes the Watchers as \"fallen angels\".Some ancient astronaut proponents argue that this story is a historical account of extraterrestrials visiting Earth, called Watchers because their mission was to observe humanity. Some of the extraterrestrials disobeyed orders; they made contact with humans, cross-bred with human females, and shared knowledge with them. The Nephilim were thus half-human-half-extraterrestrial hybrids.Chuck Missler and Mark Eastman argue that modern UFOs carry the fallen angels, or offspring of fallen angels, and that \"Noah\'s genealogy was not tarnished by the intrusion of fallen angels.  It seems that this adulteration of the human gene pool was a major problem on the planet earth\".Von Däniken also suggests that the two angels who visited Lot in Genesis 19 were ancient astronauts, who used atomic weapons to destroy the city of Sodom.Marc Dem reinterprets the Book of Genesis by writing that humanity started on another planet and that the God of the Bible is an extraterrestrial.\n\n\n==== Book of Ezekiel ====\n\nIn the Old Testament, Chapter 1 of the Book of Ezekiel recounts a vision in which Ezekiel sees \"an immense cloud\" that contains fire and emits lightning and \"brilliant light\". It continues: \"The center of the fire looked like glowing metal, and in the fire was what looked like four living creatures\". These creatures are described as winged and humanoid, they \"sped back and forth like flashes of lightning\" and \"fire moved back and forth among the creatures\". The passage goes on to describe four shiny objects, each appearing \"like a wheel intersecting a wheel\". These objects could fly and they moved with the creatures: \"When the living creatures moved, the wheels beside them moved; and when the living creatures rose from the ground, the wheels also rose\".In Chapter 4 of Chariots of the Gods?, entitled \"Was God an Astronaut?\", von Däniken suggests that Ezekiel had seen a spaceship or spaceships; this hypothesis had been put forward by Morris Jessup in 1956 and by Arthur W. Orton in 1961. A detailed version of this hypothesis was described by Josef F. Blumrich in his book The Spaceships of Ezekiel (1974).\n\n\n==== Elsewhere in the Bible ====\nThe characteristics of the Ark of the Covenant and the Urim and Thummim have been said to suggest high technology, perhaps from alien origins.Robert Dione and Paul Misraki published books in the 1960s describing the events in the Bible as caused by alien technology. Barry Downing, a Presbyterian minister, wrote a book in 1968 arguing that Jesus was an extraterrestrial, citing John 8:23 and other biblical verses as evidence.Some ancient astronaut proponents such as Von Däniken and Barry Downing believe that the concept of hell in the Bible could be a real description of the planet Venus brought to Earth by extraterrestrials showing photos of the hot surface on Venus to humans.  Proponents of the hypothesis state that \'God\' and \'Satan\' were aliens that disagreed on whether or not human beings should be allowed the information that is offered by the tree of knowledge.  David Childress, a leading proponent of ancient astronaut creation hypothesis, compares this story to the Greek tale of Prometheus, who gave mankind the knowledge of fire.  Ancient Astronaut theorists believe the biblical concept of Satan is based on a misunderstood visit by extraterrestrials.  Erich von Däniken posited that the descendants of extraterrestrials had children with hominids, and this was referred to in the Bible as the \"Original sin.\" Von Däniken believes that the biblical great flood was punishment after an extraterrestrial \'God\' discovered that earthbound, fallen angels were mating with ape-like early humans.\n\n\n==== Irish Book of Invasions ====\nChildress and others have written that the passage in the Book of Invasions describing the arrival of the Tuatha Dé Danann in Ireland, records \"the arrival of aliens in spacecraft with cloaking devices\" at Slieve Anierin. The key text states “so that they were the Tuatha De Danand who came to Ireland. In this wise they came, in dark clouds. They landed on the mountains of Conmaicne Rein in Connacht and they brought a darkness over the sun for three days and three nights\".\n\n\n=== Ancient artwork ===\n\n\n==== Worldwide petroglyphic evidence ====\nAncient astronaut theorists believe Hopi cave drawings of Kachinas found in the southwestern desert, link the origins of Hopi and Zuni tribes with \"star people\". They point to similar etchings elsewhere as evidence that extraterrestrials visited many different ancient civilizations.\nOther artistic support for the ancient astronaut hypothesis has been sought in Palaeolithic cave paintings. Wondjina in Australia and in the Rock Drawings in Valcamonica, in Italy (seen above) are said to bear a resemblance to present day astronauts. Supporters of the ancient astronaut hypothesis sometimes argue that similarities such as dome shaped heads, interpreted as beings wearing space helmets, prove that early man was visited by an extraterrestrial race.More support of this hypothesis draws upon what are said to be representations of flying saucers in medieval and renaissance art.\n\n\n==== Nazca Lines ====\n\nThe ancient Nazca Lines are hundreds of huge ground drawings etched into the high desert of southern Peru. Some are stylized animals and humanoid figures, while others are merely straight lines hundreds of meters long. As the figures were made to be seen from a great height, they have been linked with the ancient astronaut hypothesis. In the 1970s, the pseudohistorical writer Erich von Däniken popularized a notion that the Nazca lines and figures could have been made \"according to instructions from aircraft\" and that the longer and wider lines might be runways for spacecraft. According to archaeologist Kenneth Feder, Von Däniken\'s extraterrestrial interpretation is not supported by any evidence. Feder wrote that \"the lines are interpreted by archaeologists as ceremonial pathways of the ancient Nazca people; they were used precisely in this way in the fairly recent past.\"Professor Joe Nickell of the University of Kentucky, was able to re-create one of the figures using only wooden stakes and string.\n\n\n=== Ancient artifacts ===\nProponents of the ancient astronauts idea say some artifacts discovered in Egypt (the Saqqara Bird) and Colombia-Ecuador are similar to modern planes and gliders. These artifacts have been interpreted by mainstream archaeologists, however, as stylized representations of birds and insects.\n\n\n=== Megalithic sites ===\n\nProposed evidence for ancient astronauts includes the existence of ancient monuments and megalithic ruins such as the Giza pyramids of Egypt, Machu Picchu in Peru, or Baalbek in Lebanon, the Moai of Easter Island and Stonehenge of England. Supporters say that these stone structures could not have been built with the technical abilities and tools of the people of the time and further argue that many could not be duplicated even today. They suggest that the large size of the building stones, the precision with which they were laid, and the distances many were transported leaves the question open as to who constructed these sites.These ideas are categorically rejected by mainstream archeology. Some mainstream archeologists have participated in experiments to move large megaliths. These experiments have succeeded in moving megaliths up to at least 40 tons, and they have speculated that with a larger workforce larger megaliths could be towed with the use of known ancient technology. Such allegations are not unique in history, however, as similar reasoning lay behind the wonder of the Cyclopean masonry walling at Mycenaean cities in the eyes of Greeks of the following \"Greek Dark Ages\", who believed that the giant Cyclops had built the walls.\n\n\n=== Religious and cultural practices ===\n\nA number of ancient cultures, such as the Ancient Egyptians and some Native Americans, artificially lengthened the skulls of their children. Some ancient astronaut proponents propose that this was done to emulate extraterrestrial visitors, whom they saw as gods. Among the ancient rulers depicted with elongated skulls are pharaoh Akhenaten and Nefertiti. It has been pointed out that the Grey aliens, as described by many alien abductees, have similarly shaped heads. In the program Ancient Aliens it was suggested that the owners of the biggest of the lengthened skulls may be human-extraterrestrial hybrids.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\n\nAncient astronauts have been addressed frequently in science fiction and horror fiction in many different media. In a 2004 article in Skeptic magazine, Jason Colavito writes that von Däniken borrowed many of the book\'s concepts from Le Matin des Magiciens (Morning of the Magicians), that this book in turn was heavily influenced by the Cthulhu Mythos, and that the core of the ancient astronaut hypothesis originates in H. P. Lovecraft\'s works \"The Call of Cthulhu\" and At the Mountains of Madness. Jason Colavito later expanded on this idea in his book The Cult of Alien Gods: H. P. Lovecraft and Extraterrestrial Pop Culture.\nAncient Aliens is a television series that features the main proponents of the ancient astronaut hypothesis, such as Giorgio A. Tsoukalos, David Childress, Erich von Däniken, Steven M. Greer, and Nick Pope.\n\n\n== Proponents ==\nMany publications have argued for the ancient astronauts hypotheses.

(160, 'Close encounter of Cussac', 'The Close encounter of Cussac is the name given to claims of a close encounter with alien beings by a young brother and sister in Cussac, Cantal, France.On Aug. 29, 1967, a 13-year-old boy and his 9-year-old sister told local police they were watching cows in a field and saw \"four small black beings about 47 inches tall\" who appeared to rise in the air and enter \"a round spaceship, about 15 feet in diameter\" that was hovering over the field. The police noted \"sulfur odor and the dried grass\" at the place where the sphere was alleged to have taken off. The children\'s story is one of the reports of UFO sightings investigated by the French government made public in a mass release of documents in March 2007 which received so many hits on its first day that the site crashed.\n\n\n== See also ==\nUFO sightings in France\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nReport on the Scientific Council - GEPAN, t. 4, National Centre for Space Studies, 140, June 1978 No. 68.\nThierry Pinvidic, \"Witnesses to a\" legend \": a case of UFO sighting \'in\' Communications\', No. 52, October 1990, p. 311-335.\nThierry Pinvidic, \"A classic that has a hard time\" in Pinvindic Thiery (ed). \'UFO: towards an anthropology of contemporary myth\', Editions Heimdal, Paris, 1993, p. 199-209.', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b4/Ambox_important.svg'),
(161, 'Majestic 12', 'In UFO conspiracy theories, Majestic 12 (or MJ-12) is the code name of an alleged secret committee of scientists, military leaders, and government officials, formed in 1947 by an executive order by U.S. President Harry S. Truman to facilitate recovery and investigation of alien spacecraft. The concept originated in a series of supposedly leaked secret government documents first circulated by ufologists in 1984. Upon examination, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) declared the documents to be \"completely bogus\", and many ufologists consider them to be an elaborate hoax. Majestic 12 remains popular among some UFO conspiracy theorists and the concept has appeared in popular culture including television, film and literature.\n\n\n== History and analysis ==\nThe concept of \"Majestic Twelve\" emerged during a period in the 1980s when ufologists believed there had been a cover-up of the Roswell UFO incident and speculated some secretive upper tier of the United States government was responsible. Their suppositions appeared to be confirmed in 1984 when ufologist Jaime Shandera received an envelope containing film which, when developed, showed images of eight pages of documents that appeared to be briefing papers describing \"Operation Majestic Twelve\". The documents purported to reveal a secret committee of twelve, supposedly authorized by United States President Harry S. Truman in 1952, and explain how the crash of an alien spacecraft at Roswell in 1947 had been concealed, how the recovered alien technology could be exploited, and how the United States should engage with extraterrestrial life in the future.Shandera and his ufologist colleagues Stanton T. Friedman and Bill Moore say they later received a series of anonymous messages that led them to find what has been called the \"Cutler/Twining memo\" in 1985 while searching declassified files in the National Archives. Purporting to be written by President Eisenhower\'s assistant Robert Cutler to General Nathan F. Twining and containing a reference to Majestic 12, the memo is widely held to be a forgery, likely planted as part of a hoax. Historian Robert Goldberg wrote that the ufologists came to believe the story despite the documents being \"obviously planted to bolster the legitimacy of the briefing papers\".Claiming to be connected to the United States Air Force Office of Special Investigations, a man named Richard Doty told filmmaker Linda Moulton Howe that the MJ-12 story was true, and showed Howe unspecified documents purporting to prove the existence of small, grey humanoid aliens originating from the Zeta Reticuli star system. Doty reportedly promised to supply Howe with film footage of UFOs and an interview with an alien being, although no footage ever materialized.Soon, distrust and suspicion led to disagreements within the ufology community over the authenticity of the MJ-12 documents, and Moore was accused of taking part in an elaborate hoax, while other ufologists and debunkers such as Philip J. Klass were accused of being \"disinformation agents\".Klass\'s investigation of the MJ-12 documents found that Robert Cutler was actually out of the country on the date he supposedly wrote the \"Cutler/Twining memo\", and that the Truman signature was \"a pasted-on photocopy of a genuine signature —including accidental scratch marks — from a memo that Truman wrote to Vannevar Bush on October 1, 1947\". Klass dismissed theories that the documents were part of a disinformation campaign as \"ridiculous\", saying they contained numerous flaws that could never fool Soviet or Chinese intelligence. Other discrepancies noted by Klass included the use of a distinctive date format that matched one used in Moore\'s personal letters, and a conversation reported by Brad Sparks in which Moore confided that he was contemplating creating and releasing some hoax Top Secret documents in hopes that such bogus documents would encourage former military and intelligence officials who knew about the government\'s (alleged) UFO coverup to break their oaths of secrecy.The FBI began its own investigation of the supposed \"secret\" documents and quickly formed doubts as to their authenticity. The United States Air Force Office of Special Investigations stated that no such committee had ever been authorized or formed, and that the documents were \"bogus\". The FBI subsequently declared the MJ-12 documents to be \"completely bogus\".Later in 1996, a document called the MJ-12 \"Special Operations Manual\" circulated among ufologists. It is also widely considered to be a fake and \"a continuation of the MJ-12 myth\".Ufologists Linda Moulton Howe and Stanton T. Friedman believe the MJ12 Documents are authentic. Friedman examined the documents and has argued that the United States government has conspired to cover up knowledge of a crashed extraterrestrial spacecraft.According to journalist Howard Blum the name \"Majestic 12\" had been prefigured in the UFO community when Bill Moore asked National Enquirer reporter Bob Pratt in 1982 to collaborate on a novel called MAJIK-12. Because of this, Blum writes, Pratt had always been inclined to think the Majestic 12 documents a hoax.Scientific skeptic author Brian Dunning investigated the history of the subject, and reported his findings in the 2016 Skeptoid podcast episode \"The Secret History of Majestic 12\". He concluded that, rather than a hoax perpetrated by the UFO community, it is likely the papers were actually part of a disinformation campaign of the US government meant to deflect attention from secret Air Force projects. Referring to the MJ-12 documents, Dunning states:\n\nThey were classic disinformation, false documents created to play a role in real national security. They were designed and written for specific marks who did with them exactly what they were meant to. They took advantage of well-meaning patriots who wanted enhanced national security, and who, by being easy to fool, ended up providing exactly that.\n\n\n== Alleged members ==\nThe following individuals were described in the Majestic 12 documents as \"designated members\" of Majestic 12.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nThe 1997 Roleplaying Game Delta Green, a modern-day sourcebook for Call of Cthulhu, has MAJESTIC-12 as a major rival and enemy of the eponymous organization. Similar to Delta Green, they are a government conspiracy dealing with the unnatural and the Mythos, formed mostly by CIA, NSA and NRO agents. In Delta Green MAJESTIC was founded after the Roswell incident and soon made frequent contact with the greys, which deliver them technology. Secretly the greys are actually vessel bodies created by the Mi-Go and used to hide their true form to humans and to perform secret experiments on humanity. MAJESTIC-12 made a deal with the US government, and in exchange of power and with the help of the grey technology, MAJESTIC delivers \"The Report\", containing extensive intelligence on every enemy military asset in the world, such as Soviet nuclear arsenal.  In the 2016 standalone game, MAJESTIC-12 loses their power after a series of successful Delta Green operations against the Mi-Go makes the greys end contact with MAJESTIC. The organization is subsequently destroyed by Delta Green and by 2002 after the September 11 attacks, is absorbed by a now official Delta Green into \"The Program\", NSA and other contractors of the Military–industrial complex such as the fictional Marsh Industries.\nThe Majestic 12 stories inspired the television series Dark Skies and have appeared as a plot element in The X-Files, as well as in the Electronic Arts ARG \'Majestic\'.\nThe 2005 video game Destroy All Humans! has the protagonist, an alien landed in 1950s rural America, fighting agents of \"Majestic\".\nAlien abduction claimant Whitley Strieber wrote a novel called Majestic in 1989 that focused on the origins of MJ-12.\nIn video game Tomb Raider III, \"MJ-12\" can be printed across large movable boxes in one of the levels.\nMJ-12 is featured heavily in the Eidos Interactive game Deus Ex, released on PC and Macintosh in 2000. The game was later released on the PlayStation 2, and again on the PlayStation 3.\nIn the comic book series Atomic Robo, Majestic 12 is a top secret government agency tasked with weaponizing so-called \"Tesla-tech\" uncovered by the FBI in the wake of Nikola Tesla\'s mysterious death. Founded by President Truman, under the advice of Secretary of Defense Forrestal in 1947, Majestic 12 becomes Task Force ULTRA after the events of Atomic Robo and the Savage Sword of Dr. Dinosaur.\nMJ-12 features in The Secret History of Twin Peaks, written by the show\'s co-writer Mark Frost.\nMJ-12 is referenced in episode 9 of the cyberpunk anime Serial Experiments Lain.\nMJ-12 is referenced by the line \"Twelve majestic Lies\" in the Blink-182 song \"Aliens Exist.\"\nMJ-12 is referenced in the Clutch song \"Animal Farm\" on their self-titled album.\nMajestic-12 is the name of a track on the album titled Forever Sounds by the band Wussy.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nStanton T.

(163, 'Westendorff UFO sighting', 'This is a list of alleged sightings of unidentified flying objects or UFOs in Brazil.\n\n\n== 1947 ==\nOn 23 July 1947, topographer José Higgins was working with many laborers in Bauru, São Paulo. Suddenly, they heard an extremely sharp sound. Some moments later, they saw a lens-shaped object landing near them. The workmen run away leaving Higgins alone. The man reported that three humanoid figures emerged from the UFO and spoke to him in an unknown language; after about a half-hour, they returned to the UFO which then took them away.\n\n\n== 1952 ==\nOn 5 May 1952, the journalist Joao Martins and the photographer Eduardo Keffel claimed to have seen a flying disk in the vicinity of Barra da Tijuca. Keffel took some photographs of the UFO, which were published by the magazine O Cruzeiro.\n\n\n== 1957 ==\nOn 13 September 1957 The journalist Ibrahim Sued received an envelope containing a letter and three fragments of metal. The author of the letter wrote that he saw a UFO which exploded in the sky over the beach of Ubatuba; he collected some fragments and sent three of these to the journal together with the letter. Sued sent the fragments to a laboratory which analyzed them and discovered that they consisted of pure magnesium. James Harder and other ufologists came to the conclusion that the fragments of Ubatuba have an extraterrestrial origin, but other investigators think that this story is a hoax.\nAntonio Villas Boas claimed to have been abducted by extraterrestrials on 16 October 1957.  Though similar stories had circulated for years beforehand, Boas\'s claims was among the first alien abduction stories to receive wide attention.\nOn the evening of November 4, 1957, two sentinels at the Itaipu Fort, (Praia Grande, São Paulo) suffered moderate burns after being hit by a heat wave from an unidentified  flying object, which allegedly came descending from the sky. The entire electricity of the fort, including the emergency circuits, went down during the incident. Afterwards, Brazilian Army and United States Air Force (USAF) personnel, along with investigators of the Brazilian Air Force, flew to the fort to interview the soldiers. USAF\'s Donald Keyhoe expressed his opinions on the case:\"Such civilization could see that in Earth we now have atomic bombs and that we are quickly improving our rockets. Given the past history of mankind - frequent wars showing a belligerent human race - they must have become alarmated. We should, therefore, expect, specially at this times, to receive such visits. According to this, the main objective of the aliens would be to watch our space improvements, fearing we could become a threat to other planets. If this hypothesis is exact, it could be expanded to link the launching of the Sputniks with the attack to the Fort Itaipu. However, this sounded absurd for all investigators. It would mean that the aliens would be worried about our firsts steps in space, and by small space ships so primitive that would look like a canoe if compared to a transatlantic liner. It would also mean  that those burnings had the purpose of demonstrate the superior weapons they could use against the aggressive explorers coming from the Earth. However, we were still far from the piloted space flight, even to the Moon. According to the human logic, we would not be able to threaten a superior space ship - not now nor later.\"\n\nIn 2008, a document reporting the incident was written at the Brazilian Embassy in the United States.\n\n\n== 1958 ==\n\nAt 12:00 pm of 16 January 1958, the Brazilian ship Almirante Saldanha, taking part in projects of the Ano Geofísico Internacional, was preparing to sail away from Ilha de Trindade, off the coast of Espírito Santo.  Captain Viegas was on the deck with several scientists and members of the crew when he suddenly noticed a flying object, which had a “ring” around it, just like Saturn. Everyone reportedly saw the UFO at the same time.  It came to the island from the east, flew towards the Pico Desejado (Wished Peak), made a step turn and went away very quickly to the northwest.  As soon as the object was noticed Almiro Baraúna was requested for photographing. After getting the camera and going up the quarter-deck, he stated that he managed to take pictures of the object.\n\n\n== 1966 ==\n\nTwo men were found dead near Niterói. Both were wearing lead masks. A UFO allegedly was seen flying near the point where both died.\n\n\n== 1977 ==\nThe Colares flap refers to an outbreak of UFO sightings that occurred in 1977 on the Brazilian island of Colares. During the outbreak, the UFOs allegedly attacked the citizens with intense beams of radiation that left burn marks and puncture wounds. These sightings led to the Brazilian government dispatching a team to investigate under the codename Operation Saucer (Portuguese: Prato, see below), but the government later recalled the team and classified the files until the late 1990s.\nThe first operation of the Brazilian Air Force created only to investigate UFO-related issues. This operation was started shortly after the Colares UFO flap.\n\n\n== 1979 ==\nOn the evening of 28 July 1979, security guard Antonio Carlos Ferreira was allegedly abducted from his workplace - a furniture factory in Mirassol, São Paulo. According to his own accounts, he was approached by three humanoid figures who tranquilized and took him aboard a small ship which ferried him to a larger craft further away. There, he said he was positioned in front of a large television-like device and presented with a variety of images before being forced to mate with a female alien, after which he was tranquilized again and returned to the ground. Ferreira described the creatures as being approximately 1.2 meters tall with pointed ears, slanted eyes and human-like mouths. They lacked eyebrows or eyelashes and spoke in a language that superficially resembled Japanese. Some were said to have dark skin and red curly hair, while others had light skin and straight black hair. The ship was spherical with three undercarriage-like legs protruding from the bottom, with the interior lit by bright red and green lights. Ferreira states that he encountered the aliens again in 1982, with the craft supposedly landing close enough for him to see the female alien and a childlike alien observing him from a distance. He said he experienced a third encounter later in 1982 in which he was taken into the hangar of an alien craft via a green beam of light before being injected with a yellow substance. He said he was then taken to meet the two aliens once more, the younger of whom he was led to believe was his own child. Other encounters are said to have followed, to a total of 16 or 20 between 1979 and 1989.\n\n\n== 1980 ==\nElias Seixas de Mattos was a truck driver from Rio de Janeiro in 1980, when he had suffered an unexplainable experience. His story, along with the ones from his two friends, has earned an important page in the history of Brazilian Ufology because of the quantity of details he displayed to describe the situations.\n\n\n== 1986 ==\nA series of UFO sightings all over the states of Southeastern Brazil.\n\n\n== 1996 ==\n\nThe Varginha UFO incident was an incident in Varginha, Brazil, in 1996 involving reports of unidentified flying objects and strange creatures (allegedly extraterrestrials) which were supposedly captured by Brazilian officials.\nIn Saragonha Island, at Patos Lagoon, Haroldo Westendorff witnessed a cone-shaped UFO, 50 to 60 meters tall, with a base as big as a soccer stadium. He flew around the object for some 15 minutes, keeping 100 meters of distance. The object was spinning around itself and heading towards the sea and was spotted at the radar of Infraero\'s room at Pelotas\' airport. It was not detected by Cindacta II in Curitiba, Paraná, which was responsible for watching the skies of southern Brazil. Westendorff also reported a smaller object coming out of the top of the big UFO, which climbed into the skies at a very fast speed, with the larger UFO following shortly afterwards. The Ministry of Aeronautics kept a secret investigation of the object seen by Westendorff.\n\n\n== 2008 ==\nIn 2014, a document called \"Dossier Riolândia\" was produced by the amateur organization Inape (Instituto de Astronomia e Pesquisa Espacial (Institute of Astronomy and Space Research in Portuguese)) which allegedly shows the appearance of UFOs in the city of Riolândia on January 20, 2008.\n\n\n== 2013 ==\nOn 19 June, a light was visible in the sky over one of the protests in Brazil, and seen by thousands attending the event. It was reported to be an UFO, but it was actually a drone used by local newspaper Folha de S. Paulo in order to shoot aerial images of the demonstrations.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of UFO sightings\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMUFON - Last 20 UFO Sightings and Pictures\nUFO-SIGHTINGS: The Unforgettable Experience\nFenomenum (Brazilian site)', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/32/Registro_de_avistamento_de_Objeto_Voador_N%C3%A3o_Identificado_-_OVNI_ocorrido_em_dezembro_de_1977'),

(165, 'Kaikoura lights', 'The Kaikoura lights is a name given by the New Zealand media to a series of UFO sightings that occurred in December 1978, over the skies above the Kaikoura mountain ranges in the northeast of New Zealand\'s South Island. The first sightings were made on 21 December when the crew of a Safe Air Ltd cargo aircraft began observing a series of strange lights around their Armstrong Whitworth AW.660 Argosy aircraft, which tracked along with their aircraft for several minutes before disappearing and then reappearing elsewhere, the UFO was very large and had five white flashing lights that were visible on the craft. Some people say that they could see some little disks drop from the UFO and then disappear (they were never found). The pilots described some of the lights to be the size of a house and others small but flashing brilliantly. These objects appeared on the air traffic controller radar in Wellington and also on the aircraft\'s on-board radar.\nOn 30 December 1978, a television crew from Australia recorded background film for a network show of interviews about the sightings. For many minutes at a time on the flight to Christchurch, unidentified lights were observed  by five people on the flight deck, were tracked by Wellington Air Traffic Controllers, and filmed in colour by the television crew. One object  reportedly followed the aircraft almost until landing. The cargo plane then took off again with the television crew still on board, heading for Blenheim. When the aircraft reached about 2000 feet, it encountered a gigantic lighted orb  which fell into station off the wing tip and tracked along with the cargo aircraft for almost quarter of an hour, while being filmed, watched, tracked on the aircraft radar and described on a tape recording made by the TV film crew.\nA spate of sightings followed the initial report and an Air Force Skyhawk was put on stand-by to investigate any positive sightings.\n\n\n== Investigation ==\nFollowing the sightings, the Royal New Zealand Air Force, the police and the Carter Observatory in Wellington cooperated in an investigation, the results of which were lodged in the National Archives in Wellington. The New Zealand Ministry of Defence attributed the sightings to lights from squid boats reflected off clouds, unburnt meteors, or lights from the planet Venus or trains and cars.In December 2010, New Zealand military released a classified report on the incident under the freedom of information law.\n\n\n== See also ==\nUFO sightings in New Zealand\nList of UFO sightings\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nThe Kaikoura UFOs.

(166, 'National Investigations Committee On Aerial Phenomena', 'The National Investigations Committee On Aerial Phenomena (NICAP) was an unidentified flying object (UFO) research group most active in the United States from the 1950s to the 1980s. It remains active primarily as an informational depository on the UFO phenomenon.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThough NICAP was a non-profit organization, the group faced financial collapse many times in its existence, due in no small part to business ineptitude among the group\'s directors. Following a wave of nationally publicized UFO incidents in the mid-1960s, NICAP\'s membership spiked dramatically, and only then did the organization become financially stable. However, following publication of the Condon Report in 1968, NICAP\'s membership declined sharply, and the organization again fell into long-term financial decline and disarray.\nDespite these internal troubles, NICAP probably had the most visibility of any civilian American UFO group, and arguably had the most mainstream respectability; Jerome Clark writes that \"for many middle-class Americans and others interested in UFOs but repelled by ufology’s fringe aspects, it served as a sober forum for UFO reporting, inquiry, investigation, and speculation\". NICAP advocated transparent scientific investigation of UFO sightings and was skeptical of \"contactee\" tales involving meetings with space visitors, the alien abduction phenomenon, and the like. The presence of several prominent military officials as members of NICAP brought a further measure of respectability for many observers.\nThroughout its existence, NICAP argued that there was an organized governmental cover-up of UFO evidence. NICAP also pushed for governmental hearings regarding UFOs, with occasional success.Though any UFO-related group attracts a number of uncritical enthusiasts along with a small percentage of cranks, astronomer J. Allen Hynek cited NICAP and Aerial Phenomena Research Organization (APRO) as the two best civilian UFO groups of their time, consisting largely of sober, serious-minded people capable of valuable contributions to the subject.Until the mid-1960s, NICAP gave little attention to close encounters of the third kind (where animated beings are purportedly sighted in relation to a UFO). However, longtime NICAP member Richard H. Hall related privately that this position was \"tactical and not doctrinaire.\"  In other words, NICAP did not necessarily dismiss occupant reports out of hand, but elected to focus on other aspects of the UFO phenomenon which would be perceived by mainstream observers as less outlandish. The attention given to the contactees of the 1950s (who typically claimed ongoing contact with benevolent \"Space Brothers\") was almost certainly a factor in NICAP\'s reluctance to study UFO occupant reports too closely. But with the 1964 Lonnie Zamora UFO encounter — regarded by researchers as one of the most reliable UFO occupant reports — NICAP loosened its restrictions on studying UFO occupant reports.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 1950s ===\nNICAP was founded on October 24, 1956, by inventor Thomas Townsend Brown.  The board of governors included several prominent men, including Donald Keyhoe, Maj USMC (Ret.), and former chief of the  Navy\'s guided missile program RADM Delmer S. Fahrney USN (Ret.)\nBy early January 1957, however, Brown had proved so financially inept that the board asked him to step down. Fahrney replaced him, then convened a press conference on January 16, 1957, where he announced that UFOs were under intelligent control, but that they were of neither American or Soviet origin. The press conference received major attention, doubtless aided by Fahrney\'s stature.\nIn April 1957, Fahrney resigned from NICAP, citing personal issues.  It was later disclosed that his wife was seriously ill. Fahrney was bothered by the whispers and ridicule his UFO interests generated among many of his peers in the military.Keyhoe became NICAP\'s director. He established a monthly newsletter, The U.F.O. Investigator.  Another prominent figure joined NICAP\'s board of governors:  Keyhoe\'s Naval Academy classmate VADM Roscoe H. Hillenkoetter, USN (Ret.)  He had been Director of Central Intelligence and first head of the Central Intelligence Agency.  Another important name on the letterhead was that of Gen. Albert Coady Wedemeyer USA (Ret.)The organization had chapters and local associates scattered throughout the United States. Many of their members were amateurs, but a considerable percentage were professionals, including journalists, military personnel, scientists and physicians. One of NICAP\'s prime goals was thorough field investigations of UFO reports. They would eventually compile a significant number of case files and field investigations which Clark characterises as \"often first rate\".By 1958, NICAP had grown to over 5000 members. Keyhoe\'s financial management and business skills were only slightly better than Brown\'s, and NICAP hobbled along throughout the 1950s and early 1960s, facing collapse on several occasions. For most of his tenure as director, Keyhoe sent irregular letters to NICAP\'s members, warning of the organization\'s imminent collapse, and soliciting funds to keep NICAP going. According to Jerome Clark (see sources below), Keyhoe often paid for much of NICAP\'s operating expenses himself.\n\n\n=== 1960s ===\nThe 1960s found much of the American public keenly interested in UFOs, and NICAP\'s membership crested at 14,000. This influx of members greatly improved the group\'s finances.\nHillenkoetter left the board in 1962.In 1964, NICAP published The UFO Evidence, edited by Richard H. Hall, a summary of hundreds of unexplained reports studied by NICAP investigators through 1963.  Sightings were systematically broken down by witness category and special types of evidence.  For example, individual chapters were devoted to sightings by military personnel, pilots and aviation experts, and scientists and engineers.  Another chapter was devoted to evidence of intelligent control and yet another to physical evidence or interactions, such as electromagnetic effects, radar tracking, photographs, sound, physiological effects, and so on.  Another section examined observed patterns, such as descriptions of shape, color, maneuvers, flight behavior, and concentrations of sightings.  The book is still considered an invaluable reference source in the field.\nWhen the United States Air Force, in collaboration with the University of Colorado, established the Condon Committee (1966–68) to study UFOs, NICAP initially aided its investigations, but Keyhoe quickly became disenchanted, limiting NICAP\'s role.  NICAP formally severed ties with the Condon Committee in early 1968. Following the Condon Committee\'s report (which concluded there was nothing extraordinary about UFOs), public interest in the subject abated, and NICAP\'s membership dropped to about 5000.\n1969 saw the last NICAP efforts of any significance, two monographs: Strange Effects from UFOs and UFOs: A New Look.\nNICAP\'s membership plummeted in the late 1960s, and Keyhoe faced charges of financial incompetence and authoritarianism. By 1969, Keyhoe turned his focus away from the military and focused on the CIA as the source of the UFO cover up.  By December 1969, NICAP\'s board, headed by Colonel Joseph Bryan III, forced Keyhoe to retire as NICAP chief. Under Bryan\'s leadership, NICAP disbanded its local and state affiliate groups .  Afterwards, John L. Acuff became NICAP\'s director.\n\n\n=== 1970s ===\nNICAP\'s membership continued to drop as it was led by Acuff and then Alan Hall. By now, the organization was all but paralyzed by infighting, including unsubstantiated charges that the Central Intelligence Agency had infiltrated NICAP. In fact, several persons with CIA ties had joined NICAP; however, their motives and reasons for joining NICAP have been the subject of some debate.\nOne person specifically named as a suspected CIA infiltrator was retired Air Force Colonel Joseph Bryan III. His son, writer C. D. B. Bryan, dismisses this idea, suggesting that \"Anyone who knows anything about the history of NICAP knows that the group didn’t need anybody\'s help in its disintegration; it simply self-destructed.\" As to his father\'s involvement as an alleged CIA agitator, Bryan writes, \"my father’s unswerving, outspoken faith in UFOs ... was, I felt, something of an embarrassment ... I do not believe it was the sort of public position an agent would take whose covert goal was to  smother interest in UFOs.\"1980 saw the last publication of NICAP\'s newsletter; the organization dissolved later that year.  NICAP\'s archive of UFO sighting case files was subsequently purchased by the Center for UFO Studies (CUFOS).\n\n\n== References in popular culture ==\nThe frequently UFO-themed X-Files made occasional references to NICAP, most notably in the season 1 episode Fallen Angel in the shape of NICAP researcher Max Fenig. Fenig later returned in the season 4 two-part episode Tempus Fugit/Max.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of UFO organizations\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nBryan, C.D.B., Close Encounters of the Fourth Kind: Alien Abduction, UFOs and the Conference at M.I.T.
